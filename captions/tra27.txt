is a disjunction is a proposition okayso if I somehow magically assume thateverything I know can be in this oneeverything is causes the length doesn'tmatter I just transferred to lengthclosets okayin fact the last time you saw a classwas in the boolean satisfiabilityequation those were closet by the waythose was disjunctive classes okay andit turns out in a bit we point out thatany random propositional logic knowledgebase can be converted in polynomial timeinto this set of causes of this time andit's mainly concerned that means they'rethe classes injection Apophis is trueexactly the same words we the originalknowledge basis so until I show that toyou you take me you know take my orderTV show and start in the case then Ihave a far bigger not beta or gammalet's say as two of the sentences thenwhat I get to do is solder symbolicallycancel bit are not bitter and this firstof all you can prove to yourself thatthis is sound you can do alpha betagammathere are intro table in the eighth rowtable you consider the rows with thisand this together are true and realizethat this will also we do exact in thosewere these are also it is you're insanedo it yourself then you have trueI'll miss our people resolutionexcellencethen you say you didn't get witnessbecause completeness requires aninduction proof okayand the textbook nicely provides aninduction proof showing that in factmathematical by mathematical inductionthey show that you know everything thatis an aid is derived - so provingnothing is actually hard okay but turnsout that is in fact true and for sure ifI go back to my or the example this oneI check if this is holding this willincrease our move this one with this outso I must write them so basically so ifwe'll both jail we'll go and write thisas not wrj in fact basically this onethickness W implies G a but you shouldshoot shoot remember implies B pleaseidentically equal to any time you sortof start having illusions thinkingimplication is causality nobody thinksour business already like implicationlooks like ours already put a niceindirection they sometimes actually usean arrow and juniors are confused butthe same theories of my genius will beconfused in the base next because we putarrows and you think okay so in fact myspeed I didn't kill important math herethat's the definition so so now I didtell you that anything can be written inmy farm and it is in fact true Wj w+ j can witness w project and then ifif bill doesn't go there jail will stillgo that basically means not w impliesjail which will be none of not WR jwhich is w rj i want to check will Jinboso I take this I think this I cancel outW and W by K G a G and I could win cansay gr J's J and so I prove if I do itthis wayI say forward resolutionbut then you would be right in sayingyou cheated you said you'd only use thisroom and nothing else and thisadditional room jrj is Jail after anextra-good we agree that it's true whatyou're not supposed to use our roomyou're only supposed to use one right Imean even easiest we have been out therebut people are crazy people say no youcheated so it turns out actually thereis a different way of using resolutionwhich is essentially just like what okaywe used it two ways right one is youcheck the ghost where the now trace istrue and make sure that alpha is showingthose those the other is you constructeda new tower all of which said kill B andnot alpha and say it's not satisfied sofor dissolution - you can have what iscalled resolution refutation method andthis is actually how people do this ishow Prolog more or less works okay whatresolution approving the certificationsays is they go to jaillet's just eat negation of J dot J addit to the knowledge which now I havemath WR j + w rj and not j I need to beable to do something such that I guessme say kaboom happened right basicallyif I add the negation of what I'm tryingto prove in the model theoretic sense itshould be unsatisfied improve theoreticsenseyou should get fast what is false as aclausethe junction is it what is false as aclass of one empty class empty glassfalse is empty class so if I do this andI do a bunch of resolutions I get anempty classeverything else comes about a good emptyclass then I say I'm done I derivedfalse from what you know which means isthe model theoretic since I have shownKB and not alpha is unsatisfied whichmeans after must have been satisfied ourKP was actually consistent tha softwarethe new is satisfied so if the knowledgebase is inconsistent everything is goodif the mouthpiece is not inconsistentthis person says that so that'sbasically resolution excitation is alsocalled mad she is mad chase pol√≠ticasokay now here is not much of each is sotell me what happens no matter but I cando that say this I can do this and thisright not only when you like this andmagic and J cancels out and I get towrite matter not of you are value Rho Jthis and this cancel by Delta YJ thisand thisour chili because I use these for energymy products if a fact is used more thanonce in your life as a fact lose itseffectivenessit's not like somebody this is a factuse it carefully only context there isno such thing so what I did iscompletely legit and I keep there anybig loss which basically made youextreme we have just improved it herejust when you're feeling happy I want toshow you how this can I can show youlater I'll come back to this next classbut I want to show I come back to thisslide next class that anything at allcan be converted into clausal formthat's not that hard but it can be shownyou can up and see that a plus B can benot very ugly and then if you use thosetypes of things as well as distributionof disjunctions or transactions and youcan eventually convert everything intothe collection of the sections I cangive you a link that's it of who's therewhat I want to do is to tell you hereapproval is hard and basically this ismy most animated slide for the day andyou I just tell you in a search is hardin the sense there is a large number ofthe anti-derivative class now I happento know what to do such that I can getto an empty class but what you yourprogram will do is it doesn't know howto go to the empty class you take anyarbitrary set of classes and twice toresolve them and see wherever I get anempty class I'm done otherwise I'll keepon doing these what we are doing here isa search and I'll show you one path butthis is like a hard problem and then yougo to go okay if the pass is there thenit is either raining garbage people ison if it is raining then team is happywe press Iran on that imageif people is happy then tv6 it means ourcity through that the trash is not worthsaving okay so I'm going to do it todayI told one okay so those are basicallyjust diving right in English intomagical so I just made up someproposition names GW is grass is wetokay and all is raining SPE sprinkler this T means happy s G is he singing andso then this becomes GW r replies are SPru price th s th th th implies s G notas G is also true and I want to proveand take is not Gina can you imagineokay prove that the grass is mat we'reright and then what I want to do then iscome what all of these guys into clausalform turns out it's very simple becausehow the implications I need to convertthis claim to power for you but beforethat have us negate what I'm trying toprove and then Tamarindo karo importantyou take the theorem that you're tryingto prove negative then convert into thepower so I want to promote you love youso then the reputation of that is not ofmuch eitherwhich is deductive which I need toconvert the power for mix alright in thepower so you can see bunch of things canbe connected together this understand[Music]the NSG is psg not every resolutionreduces the cross link some resolutionsactually can increase that was lengthsuppose I have a pipe like glass and asimilar length glass at the end of thispart is P the end of this class is not Pwe are not we can be resolved I got 4plus 6 10 lengths plasma that's going inthe wrong directionas far as empty glasses herself thisyou're insaneokay junus tickly you're going the wrongdirection you want to become small ingeneral all the heuristic is to make theprocess from the resolution be small okso this is the migrating thing I justshow a couple of resolutions and they'remagically the integers you can checkevery one of the solution is correct thequestion is how do you know these arethe correct set of resolutions and I'dsay well I won't you just are supposedto write a search problem and use somevariationeverything is searched eventually okayso they are SP and so notice thatanything that I did I can be used onceidea writes the fact it can be used withother facts okaynow I showed an empty glassokay now obviously under high pressurein midterm I'm the final you can seeempty causes everything like there'slots and lots of ways people see itbecause we argue not be as honest infact this is not sound this is not sounddon't do it okaybecause you only get to dissolve one oneman literally computer monitor istelling people what that means with thisworld where both of them can be truethat's what it meansif you have a class P number cause Mattythen you get P and not P go away you getin every class that's because there isno word when both P is true and not P istrue what you're saying here is there'sno word where P R Q is true and not P ornot Q is true is that true no so youjust made it change in an empty class ondemand under pressure do that don't dothatso next one's when we come back we willessentially basically show that theseare all essentially search algorithmsand you can use your ideas of search toorganize the
