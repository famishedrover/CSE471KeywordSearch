okay where else would you do this kindof nonsense the only way you rememberstuff in life is kind of everything sothat until we become fully dementiadriven you will remember something ifyou do put a little piece it will fallthrough the cracks of your brain soconnect everything you know into one bighuge mess then it will stay so whereelse did you learn this kind of nonsenseabout taking like a coin throwing it upand deciding if it comes this way to oneother what exploration and exploitationthis is not a new idea you could havedone something I think it's in essenceyou are saying it's being used for adifferent purpose here essentially thisP basically is being used to decide youknow whether or not the network's theway it is considered to be present ornot and just like in the explorationexploitation the probability P whatcould be changed over your lifetime sothat towards the end of your life youare greedy because there's no more timeto learn might as well enjoy the moneyyou made right you could do this yearthat would be an improvement over luckso in learning the network youessentially if every time you're onlyupdating some subset of meet some subsetof waves so it's as if you are withinthis one network configuration you areactually learning exponential number ofdifferent networks they're all sort offused into this one network so you justuse this one networkso testing is too cheap we see a problemtypically is during the testing time youknow the will be saying let me figureout I have 29hypotheses about how to classify thisnarrative this one this is the bars Icarry this one is the 508 okay here yourthing as a support network during thetraining I just avoided jumping to theconclusions by essentially updatingsubsets of the needs random subsets ofthe waves beautiful idea that's why Icalculated it it wasn't actually done inGoogle the part the guy who did it I'mtentatively this is Indian studentworking with geoff hinton did this ideain Torontothen one day Jeff in term of minding hisown business and Google's hoop in andsay you know what company which youhaven't yet started as we bought acompany what so that's how tom is notcoming out of nowhereneither any of the ideas in yournetworks are coming out of tobaccothey're coming out of a fertile areafoundation sufficient but people won'tunderstand that each of these you likeindividual ideas that just depend onsomebody's genius no Jesus is trying todrive multiple ideas one day one thingworks the real question is very thatyour ideas in fact there's thisbeautiful statement that was his namethe guy who got one of the guy's fatheris never partially this guy got twoNobel prizes and they're only very fewof them one of these guys is right forthem so you will ask how did you getsuch good ideas that you got to say Ihave lots of ideasI draw away the bad ones that's thedefinition of genius genius doesn't meanyou have one ideaeNOS means you know how to create ideasI'm throwing out the bad ones if you'rea one-trick pony you are not a geniusokay so thus dropand as I said is loaded the next onenaturally gets something to tell theyare dealing with learning and by uswhich is basically deep studentrealization randomization relearning ouridea is change the form of the functionthat you're learning in the case ofneural networks that saga becomes changethe architecture of the network or untilnow you looked at one specificarchitecture essentially the fullyconnected Network is a bunch of gnomesevery one of them is connected to everynode in the next layer every one of themis not wavy road in the next layer andso on and so forth that's we see in yourarchitecture which also gives you hugenumber of waves like if you have M nodeshere n nodes here you have M times andconnections that means each of themmakes a wave so there M times n wavesremember that picture from Watson andthree blue one wrongthat little thing I've got 13,000parameters because it's a dance likework and it's just part applying youknow number of nodes in layer 1 tonumber of narrative you want to startreducing the number of parameters that'sthe next idea and that's what gets us toconnects and in particular basically Iwant to show this to you so that thepeople who live there is know where tostart looking from innocence rather thanhave a network like this whicheverything is connected to everything inthe next layer you will in essence tryto see many of the waves are the samemany of the waves are the same so theweeks are beingmany many times and in particular thewaves being used are dependent on thesize of the region and then as theregion goes next we use the same weightsfor that region so if you think in termsof this kind of network rather thanmaking every one of these weightsdifferent completely act as if you onlyhave 15 weeks and those 15 weeks timeI've shared here and put it first herethen here then here if you do that thenyou suddenly went from M times m to amuch smaller number but you decided thisreduces the expressiveness of thefunction because everything that can belearned by this compressed function canactually learn here but if your data hasa regularity and this crazy thing youneed winds up being good with respect tothe structure of your data you big timeenvision it turns out in general thatbasically University you know sciencealready told us that the way our regionof Wok's is basically has this recordsby there are many of you realize this asyou are seeing the world you're takinglittle little pieces and the brainnicely connects them all into a singlereality which is exactly my magic ispossible you think you are sayingeverything what you're not saying havethe things okay but this is done inhuman vision and so basically what andone of the ideas was to copy this ideato the mineral networks are implementedsome are approximately and what you windup doing yeah this yellow thing that youwill be essentially that yellow thing isput here so it's basically it's called afilter it's saying for this regionwait this week this week this week isthe one one zero one zero one zero onezero squat what I'm going to do is Imultiply the inputs which are in a moreblack by these waves sum them up if youdo this one times 1 1 plus 0 plus 1times 1 1 2 plus 0 plus 1 times 1 3 plus0 plus 1 times 0 0 plus 0 times 0 0 plus1 times 1 1 3 plus 1 4 so I put 4 hereok I'm going to basically let people gosomewhere ok so this is this equationyeah[Music]okay yeah what's your question anytimeyou need okay put up so the question theimpact unimportant question was alreadyasked in the very first minute octaveSection eight session who gives thesenumbers in the rainwhoever gives gives us any number thatwe ever need which what extremely slowon gradient descent so what you wind updoing is these are essentially weightsthey just do the boot play rates becausewe put them in this Sabha a cardinal butagain I think for a for a image it looksbasically an image is typically like atwo-dimensional thing is we think afterthe squared and the kernel is like asmall square that sort of moving over itbut really the important thing tounderstand is instead of making everynode here be connected to every othernode here is a completely different setof waves what we are trying to do isfifteen weeks and basically all theseconnections the connections areconnecting nodesI'm moving up it's like as if there's abunch of connections it's like a bunchof wires and normally everything here isconnected everythingthe different sets of wires instead nowI just have it worse I take the Sigmarequires them everywherethis one has it now of course my familyassistance their assistance in the waythis environment the most importantquestion that most people don'tunderstand how the game in general as Isaid in the old days people who wouldactually say they know area the onlyones who are actually can think of areaor something now in fact it's more likean albatross to actually sit down andtake a course because you should bemachine learning in two hours or lessand get your job right there okay so I'mnot talking about your freedom but thatwas thankfully but it's not only doingthis stuffeverybody has things their necks boyunfortunately most of them are bossesokay and so they're trying to improveyou are there okay so that's a very goodquestionthese are the gates think of the kernelsas the base the important thing is if wefact think of this if you're doing itfixed fully there's Network then what itwould look like is all these inputs areconnected to each of them are connectedto a different node and this 1 2 3 4 5 5times 5 25so there are 25 nodes in the first rowthey will be connected to another 25nodes in the second row if you decide todo so and 125 nodes in the third row andat each level 25 times 25 which is 625different leaves are being learned it'sso general that it of course subsumesthe case where all 625 waves are justthe copies of these nine weeksbut you you would figure it out veryslowly here you are saying I'm justgoing to assume the weights areconnected but they're one of thebeautiful things is the notionconvolution network signal representingit first when we get to relationallearning and if you think up things likeBayesian relational models relationalnetworks they do the exact same ideathey basically reduce the number ofweights by saying the same waves arebeing shared the terminology used isthese weights are being sharedinstead of 625 weights I am just gettingby with nine dates we should just movearound and I take it anyway I'm tryingto that's what is doing but theseweights I still go buddy just like I didknow 625 interesting me remember younever would have asked who would havegiven the weights here you don't mindmaking 635 dates per year for each anglerightbut the smoothie chart will be extremelyhappy then we have to make nine livesand there is not more data now becausedifferent wheat years has differentpieces of manator yesyeah Engineering is what we'll do forthe rest of the class you know it's it'slike there's a huge amount of tricks ofthe trade but I think we'll make sureyou understand is where that takescompany you can buy a clips guide fromyour necklace which will tell you someof these things but I will be tellingthe rest okaybut it's extremely important tounderstand what's going on here which isthe shade waves yes Colonel is called afilter the terminology is every color iscalled a filter you can have as manyfilters as you want at each layer if youin fact if you have Corinne let's sayone filter this filter put this imagewill get this tinny it's not only matrixa teeny okay if I go Steamies if I have15 15 of these things so in fact whatyou're getting is emailed Walliamsmoneymakers and if you think of this assome sort of a intermediate image cannotget in images you're getting imagevolumes each one you being produced by afilter here we have thinking about itinitial input image itself has threelayers are GB so there was the God's ownimage and our filter only takes theintensity values puts it into one layerthe G filter takes the green intensityvalue chosen the second layer and theblue filter takes the blue intensityvalues pushes attorney and these threetogether will bewe construct the image in thisparticular case in a sense you knowthese are intermediate filters RGB arewell-known filters these areintermediate filters the interestingthing about why these are called filtersis of this picture is because of thispicture image processing was full ofhand coded hand coded no featurerecognition features temporary featuresand the features that they would dowould be discordance and he jumped thisconfidence for example this one willsharpen the image this one will detectedges this one is basically for identityfunction that means it's taking a regionof pixels and it's trying to kind of dooperations on them no the one is thatidentifies the region of the pictures itbasically just takes the middle featureand if you put this filter every pointsuch that every pixel gets to have thechance of being the center of the photothen you get the same image back that'swhy it's our DNA transformation each ofthese basically are currently there islike for example is a box smaller filterthis is a Gaussian blur filter there arefilters named after people like keyboarfilter okay and then whatever filterthis blue is like that I just think whatgave it up this is our image processingused to work okay they would apply theseand then get some features and thenbasically give those as the inputs tothe under parameterised low dimensionalneural networks okay instead what you'redoing now is in the beginning untilabout 2013 people who take these kindsof things so for example the weightswould be decided by some name guys andyou have to keep giving them patentnon-value in the variant dollars okayand then they will use them to extractthe features andsome sort of a neural network somethingelse what we do now is videos these arejust waves these are unnamed filtersjust like unnamed functions computerthat is know this lambda functions areunnamed functions covert can generatefunctions here is generating filters youjust decide how many photos you want Itake care of partition that's basicallywhat viously is what I'm sayinghow many filter attaches are these areengineering issues you can put somenumber of filters so far example andI'll get to that very much so this isthe word the filters comes from thatokay so the normal family she livesconvolutional networks and we tried notto know certain architectures but thisis part of the standard architectureslots of people use again actually thisis from Tecate slides so you would havea convolutional layer which basicallyfor example which we have a backupfilters that are being applied to theinput and that layer to generate animage volume which is one notice theimage volumes column is basically eachwe can achieve a layer if their capitalK layer skin layers is a k k size one ofcourse you have to hear the questionthis operation of kernels is this linearof nonlinear it's linear it's just waittimes input plus eight frames you couldclassmate times input if you rememberthat what is happening here is likesaying I have like some set of wires andI'm taking those wires the same threeset of wires here first and here thenhere if you can visualize this youunderstood whatwhat's that it's just the same it's justthat images are like that so you canreceive another rectangle you would havemade the immediacy with a star scan thatwill be fine it would because if thisguy would be next to this guy becausethe raster scan will go like this rightbut I'm s interesting that's how youconnect easy tweaks that you are usingyou will to connect them in differentplaces compute out if we set up a pageisn't it ok so I compute these filtersand then this is really an operation youstill have to compute a constant of youtake a function of the inputs thisfunction is actually shared parameterbecause it is basically this is much foryour parameters to operate function butyou still need not inherited becauseunless you have an immunity adding morelayers is not going to get you anyexpert sweetness right so what happensin this case is I will put the treasurelayer here this is the relay most imagerecognition networks tend to use reducein fact is very strange part of thereason people are using reduces becausethey part sigmoidthresholds are hard to control becauseremember in fact I remember talkingabout these like three four years backif you notice sigmoid thresholds looklike this and so most of the place hereas well as here the gradient is zero andthe gradient is zero nothing ishappeningand so people who came up with or if youuseat least this whole idea half of thearea it will be not 0 gradient this iswhat I'm sayingthis one actually details even now insome textbooks it's bogus you don't needthis if you do batch Nam and you doXavier visualization it doesn't reallymatter what your threshold function isbecause it will make sure that thingsfall in the right region so a smooth youcan read and you can you Sigma X you canuse - functions etcetera but again inthis compressed period people keptchanging their mind if you're takingphysics over a period of long timeforever you know are there is this densemedium kanita to which light kind ofmoves like water in those days the examquestion will ask spell ether correctlybut then after a while Maxwell showed upand they say about our Bo zoneas we won't talk about a third way thatI just mean you keep it here we will betalking about Maxwell's equations thisis just happening right now you'reactually happen to me a lie and whilethese changes are happening and also youguys are particularly interested infiguring out all the time in everyresearch area things keep changing thisis a particular reason that you're inquestioning okay so that's the rule inand you can and then there is one othernew way there that is coming up calledpool this is something that we havetalked about before this is max poolingtypically pooling essentially means takea region I take some aggregate just onenot one value out of it so that theregion is now reduced in size okay maxpooling will say in the entire region mycapital is looking just take the maxnumber how many parameters do we needfor max pooling filter parameters whichmakes how many mates do you need for themax pool filterfor a 3x3 max fulfilled there are manyparameters do you need yessay 50 numbers and I say take max youknow sorry to learn it's much max onlythat spools - how many parameters theylose basically we also don't have anyparameters because you already havedecided there are genes at origin sothese are coming from andreas and thecombination of 3 by 3 kernel requiresline parameters if there are 15 3 by 3filters then you need 15 times nineparameters from that way this is whatI'm saying this all looks different butit's a sin it's the same as actually thefully connected network with some extrazing banks the seam banks are actuallybeing done to reduce the number ofdifferent waves do you see what I'msayingok so that's basically what happened soother thing is we do the operations likemultiplication addition 1 by X etc weknow how to do operational max rememberwe talked about it max is a gradientorder right if this last one is X 1 X 2max of it comes here then the gradientcoming whatever is the actual Max valuethat's where the gradient goes becausethe our guy did make any difference tothe heaven everything is coming upmillhousebecause we have or slowly Chung Kuo whocan still deal with all this stuff rightokay so example network architecturelet's just walk to this one otherquestion that I need to mentionbasicallyyeah one of the other question I need tomention really is the followingremember when this happened herethis was a five by five image when Iapply this filter it became a three bythree image you might want images to beof the same size until you pull themdown to a smaller sizethat's fooling you pull them out okaywhat you want to do is you want toactually get a 5 by 5 H here can I dothat well you can you pad you see thebig canvas of zeros remember how you putyour camera in your in the old days whenyou had actual photos being put under eto the friends the frame will have bigblack in a background somewhere you putthe friend picture then you take apicture of this picture right therewould be all this black stuff that meansthere are zero intensities and thenthere are only density is just for yourpicture so you can in general thispadding is just like moving average howmany of you are trying to lose weightsome of you should probably some of youshould but I would necessarily point outbut then you're losingthe last thing I wanted something aboutmyself right then you're losing weightit's boson has to say today I am 127tomorrow I am 132 28 tomorrow somethingthat because every day a bit keepschangingbecause you know why actually you guys Imean you take about 60 humongous off isgoing in and coming out in between isthe body trying to maintain some kind ofa rate so huge amounts of fluctuationsare possible depending upon all sorts ofrandom things so you take in movingaverage now you take a moving average or10 days let's say what is the averagefor your first day you just put a wholebunch of zeros before us you know ifyou're optimistic position if you reallyyou should put zeros if not you put yourtarget weight probably and then youstart taking moving average over therethat's padding okay so you could dopaddy I want you to padding then you canget the same size of the input to be theoutput right so for example in thisparticular case I put one layer ofpadding zeros then if I do this three bythree I will still get a five by fivenetwork high five high five EDG do Icarein fact the only reason is that you liketo say that the size of the input ischanging only at the pool in the yearseverywhere else it remains the samewell all this is now on board butremember the following question thereevolution there's the early years thecooling the air bah-bah-bahwhat is the last name always the sameremember I said this it's always thesame it's the logisticsthat would be advanced fully connectedcouple of layers and in managua is justone sometimes if you mothershe said I'm saying so you can translatethat just as in any fully connectedNetwork you'd say the intermediatelayers are trying to extract featuresand the last player is trying toclassify here too these all these layersare extracting features then used by thelogistic player and they're justextracting the same way fully connectednetworks are extracting except they'reusing much fewer waves because they'reusing the waves sharing the waves do yousee what I'm saying now having said thatI because you have around here I shouldgive you one more at least buzzword whynotmost of these buzzwords are extremelyeasy once you understand I what transferlearning see if you have for example youknow trade a large month a very manydifferent convolutional code and imageslet's ask an accent on sets at work andthen basically now you get a bunch ofdifferent types of animals let's say ahmaybe a buncha for excellence which arealso invidious completely newconvolutional network you say you are Ialready have this whole bunch of stuff Itrained before I show that in a coupleof extra among a couple of layers at theend and then of course the logisticperceptronwe should now be looking for differentclasses not for cats and dogs but forare you going to die out this diseasewas all these disease and mass ever onthatand
