and you're saying what the distributionis like if we particularly continuousquantity there needs quite a orsomething like there before admissionthey come and see your now theprobability of flu changes this is theposterior distribution of given evidenceokayand so in general probability a given Bis true my registration the only thingis there are distributions of this andthis both of them should have area underthe curve one right and the ground is aprobability a and B is true and C isfalse the distribution might look likethat keep this in your mind you want tothink in terms of distributions whatyou're really doing is the distributionof the variable ok put in variable it'sbecause you know it's true value valuethen you don't know you have to whatyou're really doing as the evidenceaccumulates you're computing thisposterior distributions[Music][Music]right defined as probability of a and Bby probability of B is extremelycleverly you took the denominator put itnext to the other side and this doesn'tallow a depressive what are you makinggood impressive by them sayingprobability of x1 to accept Johndistributor of X 1 all the way to xnconsider not just can't be it's X 1 andX 2 etcetera X n I can write this rightI can write this essentially in this wayX I'm not given everything else findseverything else it can then be writtenas X and minus 1 here everything elseleft fine start stop and so onis your exit this is the table bankbasically I just wrote it here thatprobability of x1 to xn is octave xneven x1 to xn minus xn given X 1 xnminus 1 poverty of expert excellencewhich now you can use this apply thechain rule it after the chain rule againuntil you will be stuck with oneprobability you were wondering where didI do this magic with the Bayes networkswith Bayes networks that's basically thebackground because I want you to seethat before you need two things one iswhy is Bayes network basically a bigdeal nicely and it's okthe other thing I will come back toeliminate or maybe that minute sessionwhich is very useful to understand butsince before that is I want people tounderstand how you get these numbers whydid we do this the stuff that you areyeah at the top of your wall is sayingyou know P the probability are alreadyin the comedy and not raining and itturns out that given that you understandthat these networks essentially captureconditional independenciesof the harm in old given its paymentsand its ancestors is the same as thatload given experience in generalconditional independence is ofand the numbers come from the ceilingsokay now the only right the chain rulein the right now notice that the chainrule X 1 X 2 X 1 is the same as anypermutation of X 1 to X n right so thenI will be asking probability of owngiven only experience and ancestors andwhenever I asked access to students sothe first fighting is correctjust by chain rule the second item iscorrect so in particular I am going backto this okay I want to write itessentially in such a way that I want toapply the chain ruleby these naughty naughty is just gentlysimilarly every given a naught B naughtE is nothing but a belated if you willnot be lucky he is nothing but a givencountry and not be you cannot eatokay so I stopped you for the regularsessionokay yes[Music]okay the first basically is this ideanovelization between using Bayes rulethis is something people assume you knowand so I tell you once just so that youare not surprised it's just a simpleidea but it will people assume everybodyknows this so remember this PT given sis vgs q ND x VD by V s right that'strue so the proper capsule sees ussymptom is symptom of a disease timesproperty 30 seized by prevent everysingle okay have these numbers symptomgiven disease is the textbook knowledgethat's the other language probability ofPC is what's called a prior knowledgeright on our medicines what's theprobability that the random operationand please swimming is a probability ofsymptom oh please mom well I alreadysaid this number is in the textbooksthis number you are having in June okayprobability of that in evidence becauseprobability of the evidence is actuallynot a particularly robust thingremember that evidence will be runnynose that you know maybe in a couple ofdays as Mark dips and people have notalready knows point zero everybody elsebut a few days laterhopefully nobody around you're insaneso it's a much less robust mama so thequestion then is can I not be forcedwish to make this because this is firstwitness yes if I ask people about thisit's going to change over time and thenI'm really a stupid how do we estimateso the question is can I somehow get bywithout doing probability of evidencethat you can directly just computingproblemto given symptom if you all compute thisis equal to true given symptom andcompute this is equal to false qfsymptom those two numbers are one thisyou're insane so if in fact the diseasecan be fifteen different values thenthose fifteen values happen to have twooneso the idea a smart ideaif you hit computing the denominatorassessing the denominator by the wayvery important to understand a problemiscomputing assessing means to go into thereal world experiments and computingmeans you take your probability groupsand compute the values of other coloniesright so assessment of this can be veryvery costly because you have to actuallygo into the real world and experienceyou know that's the point of thehardness of pores they say people haveTao and nobody answers the phone and assoon as they say we are fully I want toknow who is going to be but I would nottake part in the pollthis is very much what you say that'swhat we're addressing so the point ofcourse is if I computingthe difficulty of assessing PRS I'mchanging the people is okayand so what basically you do if you arewilling to come to the full distributionof the disease here you only need toknow whether that I have this is truehow many pieces can have 15 stages youonly need to know that other terminalstage so that but you really want to butyou can't just do that you have tocompute the full distribution what's theproperty that this guy is not stagegiven the symptoms every now - one stagegiven the same you know - two stagegiven the symptoms if you have mycancers they talk about my comic breastcancer stage one - for the distributionn will be probability of stage fourgiven David is stage two if I computeall of them those numbers are one onegives you that one over P of S which Idon't like to commit SS I just assumeit's just equal to well I did want toassess it so I just assume it's equal toalpha then what happen is given us willbe half R times P star P naught T givenus a is alpha times the same alpha timesthis star another star you add Vietnamthis is fun this will be alpha is thiswhole stuff soif you're insane in particular actuallynot only what you wind up doing is thedistribution is seven right there hi I'mEliza situationism have an idea and thenwe have usually say myself bustedunderstand so that's it this is a verycutely the reason you are you should beasking yourself that we can make my lifeso hard to do of this computation if allI needed was this way of s and this isagain as I said understanding why you dosomething is lot more important than howto plug a check because I can checkultimately computer still why are wedoing it is important that's the reasonto take this first okaywhy you are doing it is you aretransferring assessment tasks intocomputationand the computers very easy assessmentmeans you're healthy you have going intothe wild and do experiments so it's agreat idea and this is carmelizationokay and when you get any have theirfatherBayes Network they just assume youunderstand this stuff so they'll put offus so if I in the end say that probablyis 710 that means obviously it's notthat I change the rules of probabilityand the properties can have a biggerthan oneit is this time seven there should beequal to one that means if I have a stemon top of me equal to the stem right andso this is equal to say understandmechanism it all works out exactly theway you expect and what you did is yoube more computation instead of moreassessment it looks like a sucker's deepupfront right because maybe the pair'sand you have to do more computationimagine if we can has a sense stealvalues then you have to compute ourfifty planets not even forty the effectof you know fifty I true but this is tovalue you have to compute both the FS ornot the FS only those two will add up to1 you can't just say I'll compute a DFSand then one minus that will behappening well how high is day you don'tknow what our face understand okaythat's a very useful trick that peopleuse and understand the second thing thatI want you to understandmanagement authority you need from thatbase network semantics point of view howthe hours are telling you is what is thetopological order and if you write thatchain rule in the kapa haka order thenyou can simplify this multiplication youknow what Joint Distribution and we caneither medium has a hobby in which caseyou have to keep we update and we havebe given a retailer to keep you happyand we have a given me if I want to havetold you the Joint Distribution youcould write both of these if you are amachine learning algorithm you wouldknow that Joint Distributionapproximate but you don't know in thereal world whether it's a CBR meanscutting youso it just costs a continent one otherand then after while you forget at theoverall specific house is what I'msayingyou from the other hand you know thedomain and you are actually writing thatnetwork configuration yourself you useyour castle knowledge to put the arrowsthat's necessary it's very important forus or only people who know how the worldworks will know what cause is whatlearners don't know what causes waterunless the interventional experimentsremember anytime you areyou understand in the good old days wecould do interventional experiments onpeople and a lot of our medicalknowledge came from themyou don't like Nazis it's fashionablenot to like axis how we fired if I saidI kind of magazinebut we use the knowledge that Nazisdeveloped by doing a tickly reallyrepulsive experience they interventionsome people the PETA people people forEthical Treatment of Animals think weare Nazis because the current medicalknowledge is based on monkeys I'm tryingto poke holes in there and see whathappens what are this one under that'sinterventional experiments is where youget the causal knowledge in the good olddays you can find index many people sothe knowledge was improving very fastbut now it's much harder in fact if Ineed to actually ask to any expect somepeople you have to feel huge amountsdocumentation that IRB institutionalreview board certification and then yourNazis part they were good guys - whatabout our King highwhat's the name of the experiment hereafrican-americans they did an experimentthat's not speedy goodbyes - until wefound we are not basically people in thepast any experiments people try tofigure out but what is happening forexample one of the things they figuredout it is so for example telling yourepeatedly that you are suffering juststartingapparently does but would you like toback wait for me to find out pathologistbecause so because we have basically Iwant to say that a probability jointdistribution is you know for discretenumbers a joint distributions a bigmatrix you somehow want to satirize thismatrix into smaller matrices such thatwhen you multiply these matrices you cansee the matrix so far so goodin fact your world of matrixfactorization millions of times in yourlife except we would call these matriceswill call their conditional probabilitytables and when we multiply them wewould use matrix modifications here weuse this other idea and joining tableshere and it makes complete sense from asshown in the example but it is in thatsenseremember algebra is like a miniaturefrom abstract algebra that you know thatplus minus multiplication division theway you define it for real numbersone of the examples of how to define hisoperations venters's already have a verydifferent notion of mortification andmatrix multiplication for example is notsymmetric not well they are notexperimental so as you root clearlytells you you know all these things so Iam now able to compute and I'm going todefine and do the motion ofmultiplication over probability tablesI'm sure that with respect to thatmultiplication you can see what ishappening in the various Network as amultiplication up basically taking a bigjoint distribution and liking it asfactors such as those factors togetherdistribution okay so that's what I willdo in the next one hour seven minutesand you should obviously okay so I'mgoing to take the simplest possibleBC so by now you know that what isproperty of each point seven andprobably be given a probability of P notunit which is point the advantage andsimilarly the property of C given inprobably FC not given which is point sixbut I must be a little more elaborateform what I would like to write themthis is nothing newI'm just what you wrote in that fourpoint seven because my other part is isone minus point set so what I want towrite it actually is 48 I will write ittwice ever not a point a point right andsimilarly for this it might be not agiven Bthose are the numbers I despite theirbuttocks that given sign just disappearsso if we point three in our 3.7 not adate not cannot be positive and theother one is like that now that is verysimilar relational tables right thereare modest collection database tablesokay except that difference is they havehow many have you know join operator youwill just see what we will joinokay so you understand this part this isnothing newthen what I am going to do is PA givenit time distribution is property of ABCthis is probability of B given aobviously you anywayin fact what I wrote for individualincreased mean about this is if youthought of this as equal to 2 B equal to2 C equal to 2 would be probably a equalto B equal to C equal to or even equalto true but that not only works forindividual probabilities but also watchfor the distributions the entiredistributions okay and each of theseguys are clean distribution is ourconditional distribution tables and youmultiply these tables you get biggerconditional distribution tables and youmultiply them all you will get thejudiciary that's the notion ofacquisition okayso yeah so basically I am thinking interms of distribution Zarate notindividual values so the PRP is thistable I have multiplied but we have agivenokay the multiplication definition isjoining those tables and multiply thecorresponding numbers you know whatChinese okay so for example it will joinwith AP and you get a B and that groupwe have 0.7 times point three has aproblem it joins it ARP and will giveyou NRT and that's how I probably wantseveral times myself okay see this isthe time so I like this it looks likethisay ay ay B is that's a try eleven pointseven nine point eight a times e NRplease do not be and the edge is thejoining attribute right I have a pointseven times one 7.0 okay so now noticethe funny T this was an AV cable
