okay at which point when you pick up apuppy he can be either black or white orany other with the repo you have tounderstand this distinction is yourexcel in probabilistic reasoning theproposition is either true or false in agiven world it's not 0.72 in the givenworld there is no such thingfuzzy logic appearances in any givenword complete world it's only pointseventy so that's like saying to littlepuppy okay so that's the differencebetween fuzzy logic and propositionallogic what the logic face will makesthings function makes it easier to doreasoning that's why people like itactually machines use it what a shewishes don't do chains of reasoningthey're just one level machine and ifyou just do one level with me you mightfall back in fact in the nice paper fromillogical foxes and Roxy to successand that basically points are bad theproblems with logic pathological startshowing up with a reason to stop so thisis enough anymore and what I want to dois in and so here the game yes but youcan even differently this is becauseit's please he making power detailthere's even one more context of shapefor here that's not as bad but nobodyuses itokay the only thing that substitute thatdoes come time is property okay so let'sdo the commentary suppose we do knowthat like you know each of you canunderstand problematic issues that theworld is made up of statements that areeither true or falseno in between so either it's a white ablack power no enmity however then youare cooking a hundred words in seventeenout there between the white and theother might be black that's the lightlydyslexic that's what is so fantasticlistening is is at YouTube - only for asingle one in a given one is either trueor false but combining likelihoodsessentially involves a theoretical issuewhich is micrometer his name actually infact most problems people how the worldwas then or did something which saysthat's it's about our series I mentionedalready to you how many of you thousandsof farmers yeah we should look up thesethings these are things that you wouldassume intuitively what are calledintuitively according to our country butthe numbers stand in our way and in factis going to our second integer numbersin fact the whole idea of people wepredictably irrational is all becausethey don't know we don't have to bestuck with the baby reason in our headwe can find programs we can write okayso suppose we know that I believe wouldhave each other propositional worsewhich we will find out in essence whatyou are saying about reasoning is youstill have these two things and everygrow as you have teach you are let's sayin every rock is true or false the onlydifference isand hobbies nam website between zerothis is what is called joint probabilitydistributionjust as in propositional logic if I giveyou the truth table you will be able toanswer any trade you just read it fasterby doing all these additional thingslike you know so what's the truth tableworship for obviously grizzly the jointdistribution so in fact the idea inunderstanding poverty theory is if I cansomehow take whatever I go under and getone distribution then I can solve anyprogress division problem this is whatI'm saying that's what you did a magicto and let's say I say P plus Q and theP and the Q then you ridden your truthtable where those things are and thenfrom with respect to that so we will gointo this again by next class as well aspart of this class joint profitdistribution is all we have a meeting tobe able to answer any problem theproblem is then you can just usestandard rules of probability to cometrue likelihood of updates so this isthe only thing you need so in the caseof all examples we just need the properdistribution or beAJ F that means it will be 32 wholetable and the five variables thatbelieve they have particular table andyou need to keep numbers for eachother's goes first of your numbers andthis is basically what is defyingknowledge are distributed efficient forreasoning in various that domainknowledge camisa so the question isbasically that domain knowledge about ablue world essentially will start offlike Lu approximately these things likeyou know be kind of implies to theconductorokay so this is the understanding I needto provide a group of properties thatwould be what's called a conditionalprobability it and what it says is forevery node element of probabilitydistribution of that goal even thedifferent valuesimmediate parents can take that's itokay so far popularly I need to get theproper distribution of our 30 minutes toeject parents it has no waves so I justgive probability of probability ofnumber but then I respond I realize thatif I keep the probability of every one -that is such as Cuba similarly for aspeech idea wanna write the numbers inthe next lifeand then for alarmI need to give is true but each of theseare typical numbers and if this numberof course then I know them not a washoutthese numbersso I don't of course but this guy Johndoeswhat is the column has two parents sothe number of probabilities you need tokill again board is for a booleanvariable scenario if we do power K thatcase the number of errors this your nextit okay and so here John cows propertyJohn John Paul II we only connected toAllah so I just need to give property ofJohn Colleen even allow is to you knowhow is possible the same and property ofvery having given along with here's thething given these numbers I can uniquelyconstruct a 32 row table they'rebasically responding to John 52different volts of John and they're likeyou for each other which means even thisI can get the Joint Distribution this isactually capturing a conditional butthen why not just keep that the reasonis if I give that I will need to giveyou 32 numbers what you can stop and saywow I can add them up - how many hoursthe averageand one two three four five six seveneight nine ten in stop 32 I give themand I still have a time distributionhere good question what do you think youshould do to this network such that Ican give even fewer numbers no no whatdo you think you can do to this networkremember the coloring there is number ofnumbers are dependent on the number ofchange arose on the number of periodswhat is the best case[Music]there are moments nobody's challenginganyoneit's an independent world you see whatI'm sayingit turns out that is a beautiful bridgenetwork which is like this no downconnections right how many numbers youneed to give specified is fine so farn random variables if you s showing thatnothing is connected to anythingeverything is independent instead ofgiving 2 power M numbers yes you can beL numbers how many times do people saywhy this is my people look for linesbecause like this is the last thingbefore I what in essence you willunderstand when you come back to us thatwhat the Bayes Network is capturing is aset of condition of Independencein a survey that also allow Assad aredependent on Catalina Queen and JohnCarson very positive Manilathat's what you are giving us theknowledge that's a tautology after thePapa you go get enough so we[Music][Music]so so some sort of dependency relationswhat is the dependent now the onlyquestion that I didn't tell you is if Ikill this I said in this way of gettingthe charge distribution right rememberthat if I can ever compute the jointdistribution then I have a problem isall right we probably speak querywhatsoevercan be answered if you know the JointDistribution maybe it's not the mostefficient way what is your exit so toprove that this access if we arerepresenting of distributions you justhave to show how to go from this twonumbers here right let me do thefollowing way actually look at thishappy Network right it's a breezenetwork where nothing is connected anyright okay and so you can have fivenumbers a B probably probably a fourprobably about politics it now here's myquestion suppose I have to fill up a anengineer which is - not a not a J notevery one of the entries I just becauseyou're insane how bad is this basicallylets you know test I can just say it'sprobability of P is palpable one minusprobability of P times one minusprobability of a times probability ofchange times one minus probability of Fin general oh this is why people likeindependence oh nothing is not unity inthat case you need numbers to powernumbers magic can produce nice rightthe only question then is how do I do itfor this more general caseso I would have computed the same thingproperty P not V not tha RM here how Iwill basically say is start withprobability of B this is point O 100times probability of not go basicallyyou from top to bottom I will explain toyou why this works later but just goafter bottom the table okay so times oneminus point zeroat this point we'll come to Omaha by thetime of Imam I know whether burglary istrue I already know that poverty issupposed to be true I think is supposedto be fast so I just look at the correctRho E and F and X is 1 then I need toget the charmhouse care John[Music]and we are not really respond time forfor a for not it will be 1 minus F sothat v1 minus 4 times 4 and then I amgiven not a what's the probability jailthat's what's the what's like dude thatJohnny just always you have low eventhough they're small employer right so Ijust look it up what is the propertythat John is falling even though thereis more Chinese far away 5 everythingright so you know the cottage is 5 yesso if it's not this is no major problemthe problem that you have is 105and then I want not medicalcertification regarding but by the timeI came to very early I know how thespirits the advantage of traveling inthat in the logical start okayis you can play involved with afterhaving seen its immediate periods that'sthe definition of suffering right so youwould always be able to eat up thenumbers from the do so I need nothingnot it because the pain is not it so noteven give a not a would be not a verytelling when there is no Allah is 0.01in the colonies point no one may be notcalling is one -
