assignment is already violating a classanother thing you can do is imagine thefollowing thing suppose I have this PR Qnot P that's itthere might get resolved and say cubeits resolution you agree this by the wayis called unit resolutionnow how much resolutions can increasethe length of that is alright because ifyou start with a high class and aseventh class you can get a 4 plus 6 10plus unit resolution one of the closetsis exactly length 1 then the resultantwill basically cancel back part with theother guys equal opposite and then theclockwise will reduce imagine whileyou're checking these assignments in themiddle not only are you checking whetherwhether the classes are violated you'realso doing this theorem proving in avideo your basic and proving additionaltheorems if this or this is true in thisbranch the power against your things arealso a true so even though you haven'tactually if you forgot you have to haveto true and you just went to your branchwhere P has been set to false then eventhough you did not consider Q in essenceyou have considered Q because Q has tobe true now do you see what I'm sayingthis kind of reduces search even furtherand this idea actually is called in CSPterms it is called forward checking okayit's described here more slowly in thisplace but I won't show you right now butI want to just show you the example hereand say that farmer training improvesthe search speedeven more okay and the general CSPheuristics would be doingchecking and also doing variableordering which we're able to consider atthe top of the clip which at the nexttime is I can explain the general CSPrule for it is the general variable hasthe smallest domain you can start thatfirst my example for that is imagine youare trying to call the gates and me to aparty at your home one of these days youshould do it right and you're trying tofigure out the day to hold the party andif we both don't show up the party canbe held now you're ask me as well asbegins which day's been available whatare you going to ask first how manypeople's activities the outside in theclass but really you should ask BillGates actually think it's when I startedwith example Bill Gates has stuff to domaybe you should ask me now because Ihave more stuff to do than him but ingeneral is a busy man he may not beavailable so you might be only saying onthe EP a security 20 miles I'm actuallypious every night is only damn about itthen you come on a strawso you general start with the variablewith the smaller domains first that'sthe variable ordering heuristic for CSPsthis is particularly useful in booleanCSPsbecause the variables have sighs - Imean of size one upside zero remains soif you have a size zero maybe you'll doit first otherwise size 1 otherwise size- it's not as affecting there but that'sthe same idea why not use okay so that'sone thing the other thing I want to showis this is basically what's called asystematic I'm sorry this is this iswhat is called the yeah systematicsearch this oneit's basically CS businessman techsearch that pointed up CSP is if youfind me a world where our fathers aresatisfied any such world is equally goodas a solution you agree like it's likeany native and both I am minutes areavailable and you are available it's aparty right there is no difference asfar as the concern we are basically giveit domain all of those days I amavailable so the interesting questionthen is you don't actually have to dosearch like this you don't have to startwith one variable put its value to betrue or false another may be whatevervariable in this not search we did thisbecause the path is ultimately thesolution here path is not a solutionessentially the assignment of variablesto values is the solution the order inwhich they were assigned the variablevalues doesn't matter which means youcould have just said to help with this Iwill start doing a much simpler searchwhich is this imagine there are Mvariables they are only 2 power Msolutions possible right because theyare boolean variable 72 for insulationspossible pick one at random so randomlysaid we do true controller so you have aassignment start a loop and in the groupcheck whether the current assignmentsatisfies all the constraints you seethe luckiest person or not it me inwhich case is Emma Martha this is theassignment if not I have an assignmentthat's violating some number ofconstraints I need to change theassignment so that fewer number ofconstraints will be violated so whichdirection do I change the assignmentwhat am i solving like very recentI'll heal to ending such okayso essentially what I do is these are abunch of variables and I need toconsider changes I cancel local changeslocal changes to assignments so I gettwo because they're boolean assignmentsI get to flip it enable the question iswhich variable should I sleep so I willconsider all the variables one at a timesee how many might vary the constraintswill be violated still after flippingthat we pick the variable that will thisnumber of constraints violatedeverything green we have t7m sent andthen you flip that variable now we arehaving new assignment do this all overagainyou see what I'm saying this is afinding in CSP terms in sap terms thisis called win comes next you missed itand the only difference from the simplegradient descent is this rather canalways be greedy you take a probabilityP with probability P you do the editingthe probability 1 minus P you just picka variable at random however idea thatwe kind of need if you do this inessence the ability of the cleancomplete search to find the solutionincreases the probability increasesnotice that this is purely local searchthe amount of space it is consuming isone the one assignment any given time wehave just one assignment that's what itshould be here is what I'm sayingyou to understand this you have tounderstand how to make the tree of deepis the treewhat is the farmer chickie what is theminimum the way you listing it's apractical you understand this is a flipflip flipnobody copies with what around 92 timesreal people by mistake actuallyimplemented it and found that most ofthe boolean satisfiability problems andthese are not just textbook problems asI said a large cat evening can be somekinds of scheduling problems can beconverted to put in satisfiability sodon't get the camera into spooningsatisfy Brady you know with the biggestconsumer boolean satisfiability nothingdown the road in Chandler it did suckyour verification is booleansatisfiability I don't want you noticesubjects are boolean that's where thebuna magic thing came there wereextremely clear in fact I am my wifekeep our marriage by not reading thesame papers and first time we have mosthad a big problem well she startedreally being satisfiability solversimprovements which was being done bypeople found verification community Isaid that's a my papers why are youreading but you know terms of theirsmarter in that particular case becominga fast one okay so they have instancesof this hard to solve satisfiabilityinstances and then they will try to justuse this G set this one basically wasits name was G sat and walk set G sat isthe greedy side and which is alwaysthought the digital walks at basicallydoes the greedy thing which probabilityP and with one minus probability 1 minusP does anything the climax for the nonextended session is that a they foundthat this definitive algorithm forsolving much faster these huge problemsso people found really really sadbecause we wasted this much time doingall this in Chesterand your perceptions may define thesecond part of the climax that actuallyeats her to the next part is they foundthey could even find problems that isthey can't stop you should have saidthey actually thought if we back downsatisfiability problem they needthat's only generate you can talk toeach other process London where you pickrandom number of variables Everett callthis randomly and try to solve it okaythey found every possible randomlygenerated satisfiability problem issolvable exact linear time and yet youguys told us that is np-complete we justproved one equal to zerothat's will be lambda that will do theextra trickso we were in this situation essentiallypeople who are finding that all therandomsap problems would be solved by thisweekly blog of them and there were nohard problems so where are the hardproblems try itthis is lis pendens where the whitethings are so they are exactly ourCommerce it's a beautiful idea andthat's actually where phase transitioncomes from okay so here's the ideaconsider the following take a random wewill basically by the way turns out thatour problems are thought of in terms ofthe length of the class okay so youbasically think in terms of 3satproblems three sacks are all sadproblems with the class length isexactly three some of you may have or3sat not heard boolean set accordinglytouch one person per villageokay so 3sat is as hard as booleansatisfiability so in fact any booleansatisfiability problem can be convertedinto a three satisfy three like theboolean satisfiability problem okay sothat reduces the number of knobs we areclaiming each class is length three so Ijust have to pick a bunch of variablesthat say fifteen variables bunch ofclasses let's say a hundred classes andgenerate passes randomly pick randomlyvariables put into the wires and youknow some will be positive sum will benegative this is just generation ofproblems okay and then when they didthis basically they found for the randomsatisfiability problems most of theproblems they are generating randomlyare extremely easy to solvewhy is that there are some surprisingfirst of all do that tabular analysisconsider this magic parameter number ofclauses by number ofokay number of clauses the constraintsnumber of variables is the propositionthat they help us done that have wesatisfy the constraints okayconsider the ends so number of variablescan be close to zero are closely freeokay so if it is close to 0 if it islittle infinity sign let me child saytoo many classes and very few variableswe have too many causes and very fewvariables okayso I'm trying to have a party with threepeople these three people have a millionconstraints about their availabilitywhat is the possibility that I canactually have a party zero there werethree people they have too manyconstraints do you see what I'm sayingso the probability that you will be ableto find the party find it asidesatisfying assignment for the problemwhere the number of causes by number ofvariables is close affinity is zeroright you understand that what aboutthis end if you have a number ofcolonists number of variablesso in this particular case I am actuallyconsidering so number of causes okayactually in fact there were two thingsthat you should've seen that's okay sohow would a time taken to solve thisproblem when there are 3 people 3million constraints about theiravailability how long would you thinkyou would take before you realize thecan be a party you just have toestablish abailiff glasses and say they're mutuallyinconsistent do you see what I'm sayingthe movement of one is because usuallyinconsistent is explained since that wayit is inconsistent your day so you wouldbe actually able to solve this extremelyhard problem very easy but you say doyou understand what I'm saying so thetime taken to solve this end is close tozero the probability of having asolution is also close to zero thisain't the number of classes per numberof variables is close to zero that meansthere are no constraints compared to thevariables how do you think much any dayeverybody's available the second okaywhat's the probability that you can finda party date very high 1.0 how much of asearch do you have to find that daywhere the party can be held where youcan search because pretty much any dayyou peek everybody is available right soare the same to the difficulty of theprobability that you have a solution tothe problem is one and the difficulty ofsolving the problem the time taken tosolve a problem is suppose to see iswhat I'm saying now it's not surprisingthis is the game I play if I make thiscourse so hard that there are 18projects due every week you will be donevery fast you would have dropped thecourse the first dayI won't have anybody abducted do you seewhat I'm sayingon the other hand if I say this force isjust fun fun fun funyou would rock the boat you have nothingto do either again the amount of timeyou spent on this course will be closeto zero whether the cruise is Orsonextremely easy and extremely hard if thecase are extremely hard to give up youtake something else in your life theidea is to kind of make your life justmiserable enough ever feel like droppingbut you spend time otherwise that's howyou learn I'm sorry you're sure you saidit's a design consideration so this muchis not surprising you should really besurprised at this you may not havethought about this but mother explainedit's not surprising to you that in bothends the problems are easy highly overconstrained problems are easy to solvebecause they won't have a solution youcan say you have a solution highly underconstrained problems are easy to solvebecause everything in the solution whereyou can say that is a solution thedifficulty in life is in the middle thismuch is understood this should not besurprising okay so you would think thatmaybe this particular ratio not requirelarge number of variables is changedfrom zero towards infinity theprobability of finding a solution startswith one slowly kind of goes down tozero if I said this one should besurprised and a solution is apprisedthat the cost of solving it in this kindof reaches a peak somewhere in themiddle suffer like this force and thenslowly starts coming up because peoplestart clapping this party should not besurprised yes I am saying this is fasterstuff everybody is supposed tounderstand although you're sometimesbecause I made you feel feel as ifyou're surprised but you should besurprisedthe thing is if you want to do thisactually empirically it looks like thatso the cost of the probability offinding a solution would be close to onehalf until some point when itdrastically Falls almost like a mirrorimage sigmoid function becomes 0 and theprobability the cost of solving theproblem is pretty easy most of the timeraises very fast it is extremely narrowregion around some magic number a numberof passes to a number of variables andthen again fosters in or nothing happensnow if you picking random problems whatis the chance that you have big problemsin this area if you did know this verywell you know most of the body you willbe picking these problems in this areathis area if you just randomly generateanswer you are thinking our problems areeasy to solve what's the big rush I'msaying then it's the last time you sawthis kind of a process this sound effectcrazily so when you start heating waterand you'll be given temperature some ofthe water molecules want to become vapormolecules they get out of the liquid andbecome a vaporit's happening all the time that's kindof operation as you increase thetemperature more and more of themolecules want to become vapor notsurprising what is crazy about water isthat exactlyis everybody wants to live likeeverybody that's what learning point isin case you forgot it at the boilingpoint that temperature remains athammering but the entire water is fineto become vaporit's called phase transition you justsaw a computational phase transitionokay we saw a computational phasetransition so what is the boiling pointfor the same problems it turns out it'sat this point and it's about four pointthree which is the number of classes tonumber of variablesthe KC table looks like it's made upokay so these are some actual examplesit's from the original papers showinghow random and this was some quickimplementation of the same thing okayagain for each value for gamma which isthe number of positive variables yougenerated 200 random set instances andyou solve them and you can serve theaverage so you know probability as wellas average cost of solving them and youdrew this curve is how it works this isphase transition and it turns out thatmany computational problems actuallyhave this phase transition propertywhistle blows your mind right and that'swhy I wanted to point that out that thisis actually possible in fact findingthat is actually exactly equal to fourpoint three empirically pretty mucheverybody found it's four point threeyou can run this new finding okay Idoesn't require practice of work okayit's just basically holes it's a prettyrobust result but showing that isactuallysome number next to for currently and ifit's mattered anyway it can havesomething really to pray and to brood ofhe and all that stuffnobody has to show how to find thatparticular session these are essentiallycalled shock threshold phenomenaokayokay so so the last thing I have to doin today's class as much as I can doyeah maybe I'll do a little bit ofreading in next class I want to show youa way of using a propositional logic torepresent change a greater function in astar search so you basically said thereare operators that give them apply tothe state to give new states so I canthink of them as actions and you have astate the agent has a state of the worldit takes an action and it gets a newstate this is what we did in like MVPsto write accept state that transitionsthey were on atomic states state for theblack box s 15 you apply this you willget this property a 75 is other propertyas 95 and if you are looking at justdeterministic is right nowthen you apply this action PS 50 you geta 75 what I want to do is think in termsof states with internal structure Statesit feature representation which you didin the case of reinforcement learningexcept you reuse them becauseessentially you're just learning thepolicy directive okay so if you have ague real feature representation here isa very simple example of a word that I'mrepresenting here is the blocks worldit's a bunch of blocks on I get to stackon top of each other and I representthem in this particular proportionalthing notice that I'm writing it as ifthey are actually predicates on tablewhich parentheses a on table withparalysis me but as far as youabsolutely can think of is a haunting- a and they will - B which will be acomposition without much of watereverything that I'm telling you here canjust essentially be understood in termsof propositional logic okay so I deploybasically assuming this representationthe initial state is represented interms of some states every statevariable for the domain I can hear thevalue fight is it true or false so ifI've only two blocks in the world and Ionly care about whether the blocks areother table other than top of each otherthen I need essentially these types ofvariables aren't able in an table beclear in a clear B and then I'm tryingto put block and up another block so Ihave a robot hand so I'd say that handis currently empty okayand then of course if it is empty thatmeans it's not going to it's not holdingbe exercised so the initial stateessentially is supposedly a completestate that means it tells you for everyproposition making up the staterepresentation it tells you whether itis true or falsecurrently that is what it means to say Ihave full observability I know the stateof the world completely okay and in thegoal StateI don't have to tell you everything justlike I said just pass the exam I don'tcare what shorter you're wearing otherday your person is so ghouls did I justtell you the variables whose values Icare about and the rest I don't careso in this particular case the variablesare I care about one state is notcleared B that means I I want to startfrom the state and we should not beclear and and should be empty let me askyou firstcan you visualize this so basically herea reason table B is our tableokay and here there is nothing on top ofit B is clear there is nothing underpuppy robot hand is standing like this Iwant to be in a situation where B is notclear okayyou can almost see how these everyoneworks I mean you want to put somebody ontop of these sites that it becomes notclear and hand should still be emptyso to actually go from that state to astate with these goals are true onesequence that will work for example isyou eat their empty hand we could be putit on top of a table what we become putin a cup of me and you're done rightit's a little time it's a very smalldomain it's a plan okay and if youunderstand how do you search for thisyou can search for much bigger plansbasically okay so the way you will writethe actionsbasically it's obvious way right in thesense do you want to be able to talkabout a kick-up action it will become abroad as long as hand is empty thatmeans in the state before the variablehanded is set to true and the blockitself is clear and that what isn't itokay and in which case after you pick itup you're holding that part that blockis no longer a table and is no longer inT and X basically is not clear becauseit's being handed so I just wrote whatthe action bars to the state it's thesame way like for example there is ourstart X Y to be able to understand X Yshould be on top of Y to begin with X ison top of white I should have a freehand hand is empty and since I'm tryingto understand X they should not beanything on top of X 3 here X is whatI'm saying and their effect is holding Xthey're holding X because we justconstructed from of the word and notclear X because you're holding it y nolonger as X on top so Y becomes clearhand is not a typical its holiness theis basically like for your you know 15puzzle you have to write the choicegenerator function when you wrote apiece of open code here you are writinga bunch of actions in terms of the statevariables and addition and deletion andchanging the polarity of the variablesso this is state variable algebra okayand so if I am going to search on top ofthis if I want to just get the goalsright yes in this particular case yesthis is a discrete just like it'spropositional logic propositional logicis discrete it's two possible okay so ifyou go over to if you try to search onthis if you search this particularproblem that I gave you by the way sinceI said initial state is completely knownthen I can use what's called closed formassumption if I know the whole statethen I know so for example if I canalways check whether people are here theclass or not if I can completely observethe people who are in the class or notthen if I just give that list of peoplewho have a class right now I am alsotold you stuff if you are not in theclass because I'm able to see everybodyif I am NOT THERE and I only look likethis and I said yeah I see some numberof people and those are in the classthen there are some other people or thatI didn't notice them so then I can'tthat's not that's not going to approachfor doesn't cross what assumption meanswhat I said is true is the only thing -everything else is falseokay
