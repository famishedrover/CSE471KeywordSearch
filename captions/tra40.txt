it's a turkey it's good we want to benice to kids so we want to kind ofsuspend our disbelief and say yeahanybody can be a dancer why not you okaybut generally what people do gettinginto this kind of an area from therewould be as such they imagine if peopleflying the White Plains actually need toknow aerodynamics right it's anoxidation is to make even people whobody patient get things done and so youknow in this area what happens is theactual gradient computation even thoughI show you once today I have to do itit's normally done in an automatic wayin what's called an auto difference atan automatic differentiation okay and bythe way this calculation of gradientsespecially in these types of structuresusing chain rule has been given a veryfancyit's called back propagation okay andthe strangest thing is that particularidea has the important code inventedabout eighteen times and the lastcorrectly married was Geoff Hinton whois very very upfront about how he gotmost of the credit because the numberones were not read carefully enoughthis time he published it in nature youknow forget you lie to you should alwaysfocus in nature and he got to seepublishes it in nature some psychologystudents read he also knew that naturewill only take the top lies in the areaso he knew that there was this one guyin Oxford who will get this paper soimpart it again when they talk to himconvinced him about his paper whether hesays this yourself his further itdoesn't remove any any of his greatcontributions sometimes the great ideacomes many many many timesok so back propagation is not even agreejust obviously for obvious ideas are thehardest ones to take seriously becausewhatever believe that children should gotell your mama that mama dad I'm gettinglike AI job and I'm going to use chainrule like it's so bad in fact you knowat one point of my I should think when Iwas teaching this Google thisinformation integration course thatpeople can please students interest inlinear algebra which I want to gothrough before it they told youand similarly differential calculus thelong-suffering teachers in high schoolswho try to teach kids the differentialcalculus before they tell them you knowdifferent ships are what are used indeep learning and read up your New YorkTimes I think that you understandremember differentiation is not even thehard helpless right with even those ofyou in calculus that differentiation wasfor the words it's the integration thatkills you do you understand what I'msaying there is no after integrationthere is a differentiation because it'sblocking check so the fact just likethere are spelling bees in the world insome nerdy schools on at MIT there areintegration beats they don't havedifferentiation bees is no definitionyou say science integration is an artform you can either think of it as agood way are bad way of saying thesescientists look at something that's notmeansokay in some timeessentially means we haven't activatedthat gotta fix ya understand exactly howthings work we should be able toactually see what I'm saying integrationwe still not not their differentiationbut she pass a long back and in factchain rule phase differentiation is thatpropagation step it's not surprisingthat can be easily activated we willgive you an idea okay so that'sbasically where we were last watchertalked about different types of classfunctions and I mentioned cross entropyloss essentially we will talk about itin more detail later again but as I saidit assumes that there is a todistribution T and there is thedistribution that is actually beinggiven by the network so the numbers arecoming out of the the numbers are comingout of the perceptron if it's using thelogistic function will be between 0 and1 if they're between 0 & 1it's a proper distribution especiallythe two values and one value is between0 & 1 then the other area is 1 minusthat it's a proper distribution on 20it's a binomial probability solution youcan actually have what you know be alogistic functions in which case willessentially have multinomialdistributions which are being comparedto other expectations do you see whatI'm saying okay so if I pack this up soif you were doing this then what youcome back what comes out is a numberwhich you can interpret it either as ifit's more than 0.5 then I have to sayit's one if it's more less than pointfive nine two days zero or you can sayif it's point seven I mean that it isclass one which point seven probabilityand plus 2 which point three problemlaughs if inside you happen to knowbecause this is also provides learningwhich by the way means that it's rainingdata whose labels are we on and supposethis particular example happens to befrom class 2 then a true distribution is0-1 ok this class 2 so exhibition truedistribution is its probability ofbelonging to class 1 is 0 probability ofa random class is 1 so you areconflating the distribution 0 1 to thedistribution points 7.3that's what classic RPGs last basicallydoes and so there are these distances wefind for distributions you know one ofthe much contained divergence and thecross entropy loss is basically dividedfrom there and it is how it looks thisis how it looksthe only interesting thing is becausepreviously that derivative depended onthe last function when we first to everspread the first thing you have to do isto ever spare becomes 2 times error whenyou take the differentiation and the to1/2 Castle we have right now what we doever spit it's much clearer it isminimization of the son of the classentropies the huge number of wattsfloating above you see what I'm sayingok which by the way which are variableswhich are constants the Q's the outcomesare variables the the P is the truedistribution if I said this examplebelongs to class to them is that isequal to 0 1 if I said it's belongs toclass 1 x1 0 if it's a multinomialdistribution there are 15 passes thatwould be the distribution and then youare soprano might give some set of 15numbers there are positive and they addup to 1 and you are now computing thedistance betweenpatience and you are minimizing them itturns out that they basically thedifferential is stuff depending on twotypes ever will be slightly more complexokayand then of course there is also athreshold function you need to have theG - oxide which for artistic regressionlogistic function we know basically havethis nice property that if you have T FXequal to 1 by 1 plus E power minus X canbe shown movies it just okay so thismuch we have done and if you want toapply as I said here if we use thesigmoid function as a casualty functionand cross-entropy has the last functionthen we perform training gets us one ofthe great ideas in machine learning fromstatistics which by the way statisticsright but when I started six is actuallyvery well connected in fact we will talkabout the only theory for learning comesfrom statistics and we will talk aboutit right now we are just going in termsof you know minimizing gather etc we canbe much better reasons as to why do yousuppose to walk very well anywhere fromstatistics is I get our logisticregression was wrong using it now theinteresting thing is already after youhave heard deep learning before comingto this classraise your hand how many of you heardthe word the phrase logistic regressionbefore coming to this class what stillsmaller that actually was the least youknow but that'll basically look at theactual learning algorithms peopleand it's in the in the okay so you gothrough all the steps many use cases thegradient descent update equations wouldlook like this the weight WI furnishperceptron let's it is going to beupdated in terms of the gradient of theerror function with respect to thisparticular region which aim should below but since I'm writing in loss whichis the error and the short function iswhich can equally be the G and theactual IP for values i I under the partof the update itself depends on theinput that the differential of thethreshold function and the differentialof the error function for the spirimalsthe definition of the error functiontypically will be AI - oh it's not athing so that's basically what you wantto keep in mind and so the question ofcourse is since perceptrons withlogistic regression seem to be kind of anice idea and they're looking atclassification there is how problemsobviously you know that problems but whoto 1396 you do when you know this guyfrom her husband aroundI have this in fact you need liberated aperceptron should see some of thoseparts of class they look right so if wehave good sized perceptron checkinglater right I mean who's actually sortof solve interesting problems by the wayI wish I had that that's right here thatwe see if I have one question that Ishould mention before we go yeah thispeople have asked this question Imentioned multinomial classificationproblems that means multi-classclassification problems it's not yes orno it's this is the data that you'vebeen given is from one of fifteencategories and you have to guess whichcategory it is still very useful thingto do which is where I said thedistribution will be the true dish willbe 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 and the computerdistribution would be some arbitrary setof numbers adding up right and he foundin this problem is more useful thansolving binary classification problemsbut you can be used perceptrons formulti-class classification problems andit doesn't increase the complexity ofperceptrons what you wind up doing isthe same inputs are being fed to ifthere are there are 15 output unitsthese are not saying so in a sense youare using the same inputs to Train 16different outputs this is looking muchmore complex and this guy which you haveseen a block there is no difference it'sstill a linear force approach and it'snotnotes if you're handsome there is norelation between people ask them it's avery reasonable question to ask and infact it's these problems acquiringlogistic regression to multinomialclassification problems is what Godpeople would take in machine learningseries like okay so I'm and peopleunderstand that this is still linearfirst class it's just that you are andyou can essentially compute for each ofthese outputs basically what you'redoing is if you're for example trying tocompute the root mean square feetsquared have an instant after NASA proveyou right you can still do thatwhere in every place for example thatyou have in the last class then if thisguy says the example comes on as oneokay then one minus one would be a mercyif not it would be whatever the error isand you are essentially summing theerrors and minimizing in generalactually for my chronic reservationpeople use use class entropy they don'tuse the square but the idea is okayso the question is look particles aredoing pretty good stop taking to MardiGras specifically so this is okay rightso as you[Music]nowadays having founded activities cheapstart to have explained saying give me along enough flavor and a Calculon I willloose the universe and we loose theuniverse not Mac moon by woman comes onthe good idea thinks my idea I can justdo so frankerz glados a given big enoughwhy did not subscribe my people aretwice in our support I can solve anymachine learning problem and then soenter the spoil sports car Minsky andPapertMarvin Minsky is one of the four peopleover 56can you justthink about this why does it booleanfunction suppose you have a booleanfunction I 1 and I 2 and so I would liketo our boolean variables right okay andif I want to define I 1 and I 2 as thefunction that I have in my mind rightthen this would be positive this will benegativecan your perceptron learn this good jobok oh absolutelyhow about a leap on exa I doOh leave it to spoil sports like p.m. tofigure out these Lenexa who should beasking about X so X are you know what isX are it is exclusive are they just likethe holidays positive otherwise it'snegative that's why you have three blackbox 1 by tau a nicely line you can dropso then they say let's try to do yourthing on an X are funnywhat is an X I will have if I 1 is 1 onthat I can be 0 it will be 1 by I 1 is 1I do this one that I want to 0 if youwanna get but every other time it willbe 0 now how can you draw a line well ofcourse if they showed this to Frankwasn't done to put a set of course thiscan be done but they put it out got somerandom thing and say you come up with abig problem which has an X R in themiddle of it it's like doing youramazing what are the star tractor thingstop posting and putting that way beforeok so X is the way you can give me thatso they wrote a book I mean this is thekind of thing now my chest you don'tjust kill somebodytranslation a step away so until itreally what's the exact kind of thingthat means came back with itnot only are the quantities out theywould have a powerbombyou would think how long can you writethis book the first way the stuff isover basically nobody need afterpostulates and in the first two pagesthey said exile is going to be theAchilles heel and they said it would befine if you go to multi-layer networksbut nobody needs that and then peoplethis is you know you know extracts itall about it networks are dead and so infact you should go back to New YorkTimes archive and look for perceptronarticles if you decided they have theyhave it that was like one of theearliest traces about yet and then youtied because it's 1960s 62h there okaynow here's the dosing day what aboutsome of the other things so in fact yousay this I 1 and I 2 it can be separatedbut really actually that's not the waythey're thinking about it originallythis part let me just come with a neuralnetwork and here is a new neural networkthat was four one four and you can puton one right to herethe W's are once and then the bias whichis you had their w4 x w1 times i1 plusmu times i2 minus 1.5 and then you takea step function that will whatever sohere's the existing shellproof that there is no matter thatSoulstice but you don't need this if yousaw this but this is hard-won knowledgenow we know by attack behind basicallypeople are trying to build anotherperson's ni work I would I would saythat in some of that stuff is happeningright now - but you know like nowsuddenly it was happening then and thenso in fact this is and this is all thisis bad you can't come up with a networklike this for XOR what does that meanyou can't come out what if you have ayou know most of the time be mark theyhave that time to be rock and that's notgood do you see what I'm saying sobasically the last function if you whotake those videos the last functionnever goes to zero for the perceptronokay now you guys did put in logic youknow Excel for example you can write anyboolean function in terms of ands andORS and nots right so here is actually aneural network that backs up why doesn'tthis prove what I've been sayingbecause it has a little bit is thathidden layer that would be needed andone of the interesting things is at thattime one of the points that is thereforespot on the ROM itself on itself every would be convex which means youonly have one minimum which means youcomputed in Ukrainian wrongly you willfall into the minimum you see what I'msaying it's like if you have you are nota particularly good mom to be here andyou can either walk with me I'm notswitching geographically which one wouldyou pickI mean if you should know when you reachthe top I'm on KilimanjaroI want with me Everest the question isnot one now endurance the question is doyou know you have reached the power forthe longest time in fact FucciKilimanjaro is allow volcanoes that'swhy the so damn beautifuleverything else is flat and shoot whichraises you need to be particularlystupid not to know where one Fugees forthe longest time people did know anEverest was the tallest peak inHimalayasif you moving - Everest is neverobviously the tallest you see what I'msaying in most places things like MakkaMoowill look much more impressive do youunderstand what I'm saying okay so whatthe mo is a convex peak around in itssurroundings there is nothing so peoplewho just sayplease my head like this and then panicit next step I'm coming down I say Ihave reached the top just like Columbussaying I have reached America okayI'm Colin was revealed right if in factI'm Regina you know Gompers would havebeen right if there was no America youguys put the Sagarika think I should butwhat are you so the point is they werelooking at this convex functions theyare pretty much any random gradientdescent will be able to find the minimumjust as even a blind man blind woman canwe go up Mount Fuji because they wouldknow an average Mount Whitney actuallyextremely hard to tell that it's thepalace whether it's a tallest peak inthe continental United States of courseand then it's basically it's veryimpressive because it's not a Vulcan soit's like you know most people won'teven know until you get to the I justobviously and then say it something moreother side what that means is there aremultiple Maxima in the mountain in termsand in the search terms there aremultiple minima and the biggest qualitypeople have is since radiates the sameis a local search how the heck can itfind the local minimahow can you find that rubble the answeris it's still got it still get what wedon't care because we will find whateverwe find say that's Indian neuralnetworks are doing this every day theyfind it India Indian scholars say thereis no guarantee that they have found theoptimum on the errornothing like that there is no suchmathematics the only way you can findthe optimum in in you know in a complexphase with multiple minima is toactually in fact anyway essentiallybecause you have to find all that weknow and find which is the ticket it'sbasically impossibleso instead people focus another machineon a paper worried about well we have arich India which is we may ever reachthe only minimum they will say howchanging the globe remove America thenyou will reach India how about changingthe error function such that the errorfunction is guaranteed to be convex andif it's not on the X we have say if Irefuse to stop okay that's what washappening but most of the time it washappening until another era you seem tobe not as bad as you think eitherbecause they don't appear on there okaythey're just as happy if something lookslike a dog and he said it's tough youknow every time a school bus becomes anostrich which are that's endeavour butthen we keep on using this stuff andthen we use this on our x-rays andpeople are doing operations on us we arespook watch face I don't know but eitherwhich way we are some have given uplooking for happy but there is also apositive way of looking at it which isthat in fact it would be through manybad local minima in a very highdimensional space remember I SpanishEmpire I have not evolved husband thisis nutscan we talk about now it wasn't known atthat time so basically these guys saythe party making the boolean functionsokay and people start working okay thereare two ways to handle this which yousee if you look at the videosokay mama sports is one song that we'regoing to higher dimension of space andthen if in fact you have animal pointsand pick em training points okay and ifyou make containing points that you havethree dimensions together with XYZcoordinates if I have invent dimensionsX 1 all the way to X n I mean everypoint has its own axis you can see thatin that case there will be a hyperplanethat separates any class from any otherbox
