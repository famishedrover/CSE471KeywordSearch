and the material would be essentiallyuntil mass class so the stuff on Juliamode is not what we do once a piece fitin in the sense that people who may havedone that so I don't suggest that myexpectation is that if you spend so muchtime doing the real test after a the atfrom there you should have to reallystudy the other parts hopefully and youcan study the ones and then we get outof the home of cancer for solutionsbefore the exam in fact once the alreadycompleted we will give it by thisweekend not later than this weekendediting and the last onethere is no okay any questionsso I mentioned this so I understand thatto have the company for this obviouslymight take you some time of your finalprojectother four so depending on how thingsare going I will just extend ourexpertise and advice for perfect for myexpected news article caught it forgetsome other day done most of you then wecan try to have an on recording variousnetwork exercises without the povertycoding is like actually if I ask youpeople are having trouble extend this aswell this class is concerned you are notgoing to lose time that's what you'relikeso these two also talked about how youcould have learned knowledge in thisformatokay stop learning you put learn logicalsentenceslet me examples okay and we willactually talk about all these stochasticlogical networks which is business so wetalk about how business can be learnedokay and that actually would also put itin fact recent learning is really thebasis of missionary I mentioned thismultiple times during the other anytimethat you know you write down somethinglike drop out he's essentially apoor-man's they are playing bass in areused to cast it so by the way whichreminds me tomorrow actually I said thisalreadyHani Karan Thaparand then actually worksokay okayso something problems in propositionallogic that we know in propositionallogic but now imagine that you knowsomething about the water you're writingokay we stood in the inference big wellyou have knowledge about the point wewant to tell it your system and then itwill do some Ray's anyway so you canbasically suppress traumatic youbasically write down what you know asformulas then andteachers will tell you useful thingsabout the knowledge we have it okaythree kinds of things one is you mayasked before this party is my knowledgebase consistent that means rememberevery particle of our knowledge isconstrained it's out of state people saythe truth will set you free knowledge isno is everything is because ourknowledge many many things are notpossible knowledge constraints yourworld is you can say and so now thequestion of so much reward that's aproblem right and so is the knowledgethat you have consistent there any wordswhich are consistent with what you knowin which case one of them is the realworld you are in right in the contextare proportional logic the words arethose rows in the tables each row is avoid and so what is added in the rowswhich evaluate in which all theknowledge that you have evaluates rightand if there is no such were than yourknowledge itself is inconsistent thatmeans then actually you know you havesome you know there is no way all ofthese thingsokay the second is given a new sentences is it impede by my knowledge can Iwrite this down you know I have someknowledge and you want to know is s trueokay I want to be able to answer it andso if I can prove that my knowledge baseand is yes then I get to write s intothe originals the point of course is insome sense knowing what you knowledgeyour knowledge knowledge is the sametake about the following questionsuppose I have a knowledge base KB with15 axioms or something okay and it isonly true in three words only threewords that means the three rows of thetrue thing and somehow I found that afact F is engaged by this knowledge baseto kid what's the number of words can beand F is true in this is extremelyuseful if I am the other hand doesn'thold in the knowledge baseI mean if F is not active you have tothe knowledge base the number of wordsis going to be less than III could bezero could be two would be one but lessthan threethat's how additional knowledgeconstrains this is easier than say thinkof knowledge as not straight okay themore you know the fewer things yourealizeactually possible okay so anything andthing essentially was already true inthe words that your knowledge base isscrewing you just didn't realize itjeez you're dancing in fact I tell youthat to robots to super intelligentrobots playing the chess joke yepwhat happens there essentially the firstrobot takes and makes the first move andthe second one says why becauseessentially we have to go through themoves to realize whether you win or losein a particular direction whereas if youcan essentially do full entailment givena particular board position you canactually see which there is a they areyou mean from here or not and this isgoing after me then you mask this you'reinsane so that's what basically so youmay have learned what you should haveknown indirectly but that's justdeductive learning that means theadditional knowledge is the deductivemotion after knowledge that you alreadyhave inductive means if you add aninductive window in fact the number ofwords you are consistent with reduceswhich a very very useful thing okay sothis is the other thing we do the thirdthing of course it isn't simply truewith my knowledge base is it possiblytrue with my knowledge so somebody wantsto tell you a fact about the world youhave some prior beliefsyou can't some those beliefs you can'tprove thistrue/false the question you're askingyourself is is it possible for me tobelieve this into my put it into myknowledge base if I do a millionconsistent with some other things that Iknow of saying by the way in asociological sense this is actuallyextremely important thing it leads towhat's called transformation bias sonobody reads news anymore right peopleread what they are basically alreadyalmost believe this I am saying if youare like a raging left-wing ridicualready read left-wing stuff if you arearranging why do you wanna take you knowdo the right things because those thingsare consistent with what you know andI'm saying so if you for example hasgrown to you know hearts and is goingaround killing children right dependingon mathematics consistent with yourknowledge possible if on the other handif you have different beliefs which ifyou believe this you have to remove someof the previous believes you are noteven going to do it with this you can bythe way a substitute every Clinton wantsto clump on whatever you wantyeah but not all of us have actualknowledge and we try to decide tobelieve or not believe something basedon whether it is consistent with theknowledge that we have and thisconfirmation bias you almost almost wantto believe this time which is why thanthe news article Kelsey yeah that'sgreat why do I want to learn some otherstuff ok so that's about the second thethird thing is consistent thisconsistent if modest is not entertainedright that means if you if you basicallyare ready even what you know you alreadycan tell others then you can't be theu.s. if you must believe us then youhave to remove something else that youput in your knowledge base before do yousee what I'm saying and that's hard forpeople that's why they just need tofocusyesnot ours was if anything sex-wiseoutwards you have zero knowledge do youunderstand what I'm saying in generalagain knowledge okay so okay so thisisn't good yeah we will keep going wecan actually do this power so thequestion of course is other things withthis kind of propositional logic but Idon't want just champion doesn't kind oftrack you slowly be piped into why youneed it why you need something is verymore important in them how do I write acheckalthough you don't feel like that whenyou create doesn't tell you somethingbut it's actually you need to understandwhy do you need to see logic even thisis and in particular many of youprobably have heard of things like fuzzylogic why not was a logic and some ofyou may have heard of if not maybehearing to itvariations of logicthis is your this so many cow can I askthis questionif there is about medieval miracle thatmeans I should add Barbary to theknowledge and see in a verydependable cow in this particular gamecomes true because Barbary and Parvatitwice around will get you Allah andMohammed al-ameen wise miracles willgive you because you can do this thehard way by doing actual resolutionand even harder by writing an entirestable object the easy way which is Ijust showed you that chainingwhat you realize that that's actuallyproof okay unless you have a can ask ifmaybe is it possible that Barbara okayso the question then would be I want tocheck if knowledge base and not me andthis so all I'm saying any question youmight ask these kinds of questions okaynow this is all well and good but youalready stopped questioning theassumptions being made here this is thereal world cityokay so I'm assuming that true / livesin the real world not a fictional worldwith Butler's can sometimes disablealarms some earthquakes will be tooslight to cause an AHA even in LosAngeles what police are more likely thanapt makes John and Mary both have theirown lives and may not always come at thealarm goes off between John and MaryJohn is more of a slacker than me it mayeven wind up dancing in the old days bythe way when Teddy Grahams were unit howmany have become telegrams righttelegram was what or was used to send atelegram or service what for telegramsbeing used for mostly bad news somebodydying you send a telegramso in fact in my language there are allthese peoplestories in the telegram comes andtypically this telegram unfortunatelywill be in English and I speak Telugu soothers people there used to speak Telugunobody knows what is in the telegram sothey might as well start crying somebodydiedsimilarly if the human channel very cowsit's a I don't want to take that outmust have been about that we just justlike okay so this so the question thenis in this world a so far right which Ihave here this first question that'swhat we'll be asking about this simpleknowledge is no longer being pissed offis not acted by this economy you realizeimplies haha okay by the way one thingjust before I go forward employees doesnot equal to causes sometimes by mistakeI said us and you also might say carsbut employees doesn't mean causeslogical implication is not causation yousee what I'm saying logical implicationis not causation but similarly in factAuthority and you know the implicationthere but just an implication of a linkup actually okay so here what we watchin our Gazaelection VDP Butler is alarms alarmsdon't have batteries so we don't needthat let's get order okay so given thatanywaybecause they're all these additionalthings activator and people go down theystop and people might out even whenthere is no harmony all this crazy stuffso the question then is and then youknow in addition to writing this[Music][Music]now you see on the TV that there is anathletein fact you probably are findingyourselfit's not okay some other explanation soyou don't need to be a back is happy nowlogically the fact that it could be istrue because it doesn't get B is truemeans not to get ever seen but probablysecondly if we can be true becauseeither of C out of P and you don't seeis true okay so in the sense that if Ibasically think something like this canbe true because of C and you alreadyknow it is true you can see is lesslikely to be the strange thing we dothis is how explaining given logicdoesn't do this we need to be able tocapture this so two problems we noticethis one of course we did languagetonight is that happen if you need tosupport these types of plausibleinferencesthis is a very time to look at the worldright okay how do we have the real worldfirst hungry right what's the languageyour edited first idea and say isomniscient and speaker with right theproblem you say about the previous teamis you said partly in wa salaam okayand similarly I'm going out John houseis what you wrote what we really have tosay is Allah I'm going upand John is away and John is not busylistening to songs and John is not drunkand John is something else I am Charliesomething else I'm Charlie somethingelse there in the Chinese John linka youhave to write all possible things thatare needed for this room for fire thisis called that qualification you seewhat I'm saying if it is a made-up wordyou should be able to write down theexact number of exception cases thathouse but in a real world it becomeshard okay so model everything is thefirst idea if you want everything thelogic that you note is now apropositional logic will work withoutany code but marketing everythingbasically is like this a and then youand MC n implies G and you need tofigure out all these things if you thinkthat the world only contains those fivevariables then of course it's easy nowwhat is reappointed all sorts ofadditional variables exist and you needto think of how those thingsokay okayimagine all the things you say I willsay sorry guys if you were used to beput into in the date why'd you start thecar in this pattern stop propertiesoperators right so that's how you'resupposed to actually so now I basicallytold you that you could qualify all theconditions needed for you to start thecar okay by the way Makati gave thisname John McCarthy also invented thisphenomena in logic basically talkedabout put it in the tailpipe problemwhich is our colorful problem inaddition to the bomb in the toilet soyouin Rick's companies especially like intax giving that conversation is flaggingyou should read of this okay so gammathe magnet for the different qualifiedto the means you dip the award so youdidn't write it so you would have beatall the other things like bitch sologically should be moving okay so nowthe question of course it isyou might say that's okay what I will dois I will write this true and next timeonwards and I'm starting the careverybody will start around my god youlook at me like the stupidest food inthe world because I just don't startthat
