so next class and into cheats you canget to cheat I end up either and bothsides you don't really have to be majorpainting other if you need help one ofthe TAS can help you are she verygraphic and then calculators are allowedagain we are trying not to requirecalculators in most of the questions Imay be able to release some decimaladmit it but so calendars are Allah andwe will assume that the calculators arerequired enough but you are not allowedto use cell phones unless you kind of ifyou use cell phones you are sicksomewhere in the front so that yes cansee if you are depending on the words[Music]and if you think it's fine because butif you wind up getting like a microscopethere will be questions yeah I think thewhite of Jeep should be that in writingand sure enough you will be worried thatyou won't know but I think but right nowit just gets better but I don't expectmuch it myselfany other questions okay so I myself ifI if you walk in from the package Wowand come out of the I guess mouth thenall the bad luck will be converted intogood luck so I might do it for you[Music]so proximityyou know so you say reinforcementlearning just to get you there but assoon as you point across with dynamicprogramming but you should know thatwill leave you know because 500programming is so you might and alsoteaching a course just on the firstmaterial most people PhD students innext semesterbut you knowso these things and sprinklers and rainyand wet grass okay either I used acloudy sleeper Metra's to certaintyfactors remember because I said thatgrass might apply it wasn't rainingmight apply and and so you can get itrecycler vision okay promise you this wewill ensure that you will never get thisa terrorism basically you imagine yogado if you remember what I said last timeis this okay so if you remember what Isaid last time is network are just seenas representing the joint probabilitydistributions okayin particular you can think of hisprobabilities joint power distributionwas to be a big number you can imaginethat the Bayes networks of factorizingthem into small numbers such that canyou multiply them you get the big numberokay that's why I saidin fact today I'll show you what Ispecifically mean by factorizationfactorization essentially will light upbeing it and there's no probabilitytables have the various nodes you canmultiply them except it's not a matrixmultiplication it turns out to be thiscrazy kind of multiplicationjoint multiplication how many have youhave they can lose databasesyou know relational joints okay so youessentially take two relational tablesessentially join them and then whicheverrows join you multiply those numbersthat's how you get factors to bemultiplied so each factor is a littletable and you multiply it all the tablestogether dictate the big table is thejoint probability distribution is yourbase you are down to just like the truthtable for the food everything caneventually make sense you know how to doit faster semantic scheme similarly thesemantics for promised equation finallycome from joint distributions okay sokeep that in mind and be this and itpush this like multiple times in yourheadsbut so the towards the end of a squareas we looked at Bayes nets and we lookedat how to specify them so here in thebasementthis also tells me if anybody isactually you know is one of the strangehints that he got into when there was apoll last where the people wanted anexpertbut 80% we you every time that Annie andYouTube every key you guys have how manypounds of being a nun was viewing thankyou chew because what counts of myvideos so so how many probably whatprobabilities to agree to specify thisno need to give ability of okay howabout yeah what do I need remember thebasics for ignored you need to provideconditional probability distributiongiven its immediate parents right afterthe knee so I need to provide what isthe probability that people is truegiven cloudy right and similarly formaintenance I need to provide what isthe property that rain will be truegiven from be even not close and herefor back to us it has right and so youwill wind up giving a back rub but thensprinkler rain sprinkler not thesevariables are bullyingfind out if the semantics of basic wordsthat you will understand in this classhave nothing to do with whether thevariables are variables are mightyvalues are rather even the variables arecontinuous well but it makes a lot moresense to think in terms of booleanbecause Allah makes a tactic very - me -this is what I'm saying and that's theway of putting it but if I can show youexamples of continuous Bayes networks -and the idea of the semantics basicallyremains the same way so even there hadthis been a continuous variable you needto provide it's continuous probabilitydistribution given the various values soin fact you can have four variables if anetwork can be fixedhe can have boolean it can have multivalued as well as continuous variablesso the expressiveness is okay and so allyou're trying to find out here is togive the conditional probabilitydistribution so what a giving officialproper distribution is wher 9wgbecause for WG it only can take twovalues so that institution for WG Madrasis what is the property since they'reonly two values I just have one of themand it is the vectra's it is people usevariable then you need to give itproperly this until at least afford itback because the 15 value will be 1 - ifthis was a continuous variable youreally have to provide a continuousprobability distribution in fact in thecase of a TSthere are some interesting how many ofyou have taken power distribution plusprobability classes and you remembercontinuous densities and you knowdiscrete continuous are very close butobviously continuous wherever you see inthe rest of the class a summationintegration if you are into okay that'sbasically okay that's that so how manyhow many numbers did I need to giveremember that I don't actually need togive this because I can get them by cubenumbers that can be computed so how manynumbers if you have four five six seveneight nine nine numbers how many numberswould you need to specify the JointDistribution fully if you are trying toplace by the time distribution is howmuch do you need to power for at thepower four minus one okay except thatthe minus one is at the base not in thesuper state remember that okay so it'sbasically instead of instead of 2 power4 minus one[Music]you sort of see how these are going toaffect sprinkler and rain and sprinklerhe apparently okay I'll get the recipeimagine you're living in a world whereyou would like to hope that empathy isindependent of everything so then whatwould a network be like it would be likethis okay then you network if you haveany conditions you will be given this isthe network that you will trap if youthrough this network so this is how thetopology of the network so I threw thisman pursewhat is the number of numbers andright funny for just for instead of mineis you're insanesuppose I'm not greedy I somehow want tolike something like this this is my teamI find it when I said cause into thisclass tink combination because I may behuge deal about the fact that is notwhat are nothing to do with causation wejust like to say causation it doesn'thave to be necessarily causation okay soif you have some theory of causation ifyou don't see what I'm saying so thisclass is something like Romney sprinklerrain and Madras and I would either tryto do what's called a knowledgeengineering approach I happen to knowthat Romanian so I will give you thetopology and then I give you thetopology you can maybe either learnedenough words from data Allah askedexperts for the numbers the other is thevideo graph so so basically I can startwith the topology and also asked for thenumbers that is the most knowledgeintensively that means you're askingsomebody currently the middle will beleft experts give me the topology I willget the numbers from the tablethat's quite cheap the hardest would beI will try to find the topology as wellas the numbers that have specularunderlying probability distributionthere are you good at the arts that youput in don't have to have anything to dowith carnation don't require anythingbecause when you do this maybe you kindof do what are this one did you try todo probably dance to impress them brainand then both of them cause II veteransmaybe because that you knew this is howthings work to avoid that's not obviousat all from dinner unless you doexperiments unless you do it inventionslike for example if you write the glasswill the rain stop falling is one partCharlene intervention it's okay if youyou know basically fill your nose withyour too boring if your crew goes awaywill do I know stuff these are theexperiments you've done in your lifethat's when you know what is causingwhat in social studies they're all fullof fake any supposition for example isbeing poor have any causal connection tohaving a higher having the right kind ofa lot of your face has it does it haveany other information our connection tohaving this is the kind of we don't evenhave any causal theory we come up withtake our theories and you know howmachinesso yeah I mean if you didn't mind mehaving this happy theory the question isnot universally for this what I'm sayingif you can do this that you understoodbasically outer space okay so that sevenwork what is that it has a special nameit's called a Markov chain II this isthe other thing if you think you learnthat what it is is a special case ofnetworks with your own money but reallymost of what you know special case of itso how many of you have heard of Markovchains that's a notion okay how aboutthissuppose I have a network like this[Music]so you don't mark our models the ideaone of the interesting questions here iseach of these variables that means youcan actually take and which areunobservable okay you kisses somevariables domain some variables are notdirectly observable but they do causeevidence that is observable observationsthat are observable but just because youcan't observe something doesn't mean itdoesn't exist so just because you don'tyou cannot directly observe a metavariable doesn't mean that it doesn'texisthe didn't matterI don't even need to go there the blackmatter in general some values of thestate would be harder to directlyobserve some other values of the stateare directly observable okay even thingslike he did what he didis you are trying to really figure outthe hidden state observations which isthat see eg in fact of gauge Markovmodels are actually M would be zero thatis state 1 to state 2 to state 3etcetera and then each state gives anevidence variable see what I'm sayingand so this is basically remarkable soin the context of this particularnetwork for example but imagine you area lineman agent okay there you have somefunny okay what we can observe affectedus and from the Red Cross then you cansee and those may have some combinationsokay so the point of this slide is tosay Bayes networks okay by the wayparticular there is a general name forthese kinds of things like hmm they callthem tiny these because the question isin this network there is no notion oftime it's all in one snapshot of theworld in the given snapshot of the worldis it probably under stickers on is thetrading is the password in the currencystate okay but normally then you havestates evolvingokay when the states are working theymade one they give time so that's wherethe word dynamic comes from and otherthings are changing over time isautonomy and so hmm is Markov chains buttypically examples of dynamic variousnetworks see what I'm saying and it'sunfortunate but you guys know you mayhave heard of things like recurrentneural networks you know this but youknow that is a dynamic neural networkit's catching the notion of time in okayand not surprisingly these things areall connected so any questions on thisstuff yesso cycle in the sense of what this is ithas to be a cyclic graph it has been acyclic it you know actually but notreally mad for the fate of the heart isby Daphne Koller and our groups name isDaxbut the pack is what it is which mightmake you wonder what about undirectedgraphs for probability distributionsthey have to exist okay you won't talkabout itso entire little graphs for probabilitydistribution aftermath for random readsand they will try thishow many of you are conditional randomthings yeah it's a particular Barcorandom network it's not particular theonly thing that makes something onappeal is that it just are undirectedbut the point hopefully understand isit's not that the edges are magicalit is the semantics you associate withthe network that makes it okay and itturns out that that difference betweenmarker and the peers and Bayes networksis the types of conditional probabilityneed additional independence assertionsthat they can capture that's a prettydeep point and I won't go into that toomuch but that's basically they existthese kinds of networks - okay but alsomuch easier to understand okay so thenext question is again do the numbersyou told me what Hamas we have one I usearound I asked myself[Music][Music]logical started so start with cloudy soKlaudia what is it it can be to mynumber it's point five then I wantsprinkler to be falsewhat is super topological sortso not sprinkler given cloudy so then Iknow sprinkler given cloudy is point onenow given how many is one minus pointone right so that's nothing but each Imean that number is coming from me now Ineed to get rain so rain in essencegiven not sprinkler and actually exceptwe know that they know needy pets arefamily that's the whole point of thenetwork and it wasonce I give the immediate parents that Iyou know in that topological czar if Igive the immediate parents andindependent of the ancestors okay so inthis particular case I want rain rainthrough given the county true that'sjust pointed right and then the last oneis not veterans so that has to be a mansprinkler and rain in particular itshould depend on the sprinkler and ringbecause that's what our evidencecurrently what it now that's what wehave so last week when I mean this rightand then
