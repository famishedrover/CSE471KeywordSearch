exactlyI amyou knowI haven't done the lastyeah see I didn't forget right to thepoint it's come to my attention thateven the cleaning woman have engaged insexual intercourse on the tests in youroffice anything to me at all when Ifirst started here that that's what thething was pregnanta lot of offices and that tactic ifpeople did that all the timeand you're fired later that the samelike that I want you out of here by theend of the day[Music][Music][Music][Music]yeah I was a very project - you have touse justify Yeah rightokay let's get startedso the return is over you gotta do it atthe second time I think that littlecollection we also got a transfer thatproject is this weekend and then thisagenda is to get you back into the flowthat we left off which is basicallymission I think we got into sharingthrough reinforcement learning and afterdoing online with enforcement burning wethen shifted to classification learningand which to perceptrons I want toquickly view those things and hopefullyyou also had looked at look at thevideos that I have passed you to look atand so we will mention those in passingand then we will transition tomulti-layer neural networks and backpropagation okay so how many of you knowgarage wall well not a more you knowbetter known game starts with Rahu butthenso many apparently sixty nine point ninethousand followers and then presumablyhe also has started all by himselfhaving dropped out of undergraduatestudy because he is so damn easy he alsostarted and he had university for themasses yeah University for the massesand so he makes give me yours everypiece I can do but nobody watches mineright so he makes new videos every weekand he has a huge following he recentlyalso of course Imani Isis what he getshe started teaching machine learning intoday's giving heart project it's somuch simpler to the heart machinelearning in two days right is that thattwo days machine learning is too muchbut machine learning so the fact thathis most recent thing he also said hewill teach you how to write a paper in aweek a research paper in one minute andhe basically made for me he wrote hiswhole paper in one week you know qubitsand he basically said this is how you doit essentially you start the wordprocessorYeah right I'm obviously large number ofpeople are thinking man this is stuffsorry turned out unfortunately when youhave 64% other words you know what youcan do basically can be prepared byother people right and so this guyAndrew and where who is such aspoilsport is such a party pooper thathe actually compared this paper in onebeing archived in case you don't knowwhat can be is a khabees file copyingpapers what did happen is for copyingprojects and you exactly know what I'mtalking aboutthose of you have done this okay so hewent and modified some words not somepieces generated this proper andpresented it and the boss of paying $200nobody pays me toward others - isn't itthe mostWow this is good to the pocketbooks inlike it looks like a paper and it seemskind of nice okay I have to do yeahright and so and then people started Ithink that there were connections tothese papers to what he has written andthis just happened like less than we canhappen so until I got busy it pointedout that it's not partly paid realizeit's really 90% which arise from thesetwo papers but the format is differentthat's important Plus also the name isdifferent he goes garage neva that makesit nice paper right I'm sure you guysknow how what I'm talking about if youtake it up or put your name musicnetcode it's yoursright very nice and then also of courseyou have to change some variable nameslooks as if you can't spend any timeabout so in his case he changed somephrases for its comfort he took thisword quantum here and he said let'sthought it the same like and then wealso say lots are complex Hilbert spaceafter these made is like making complexthings simplistic ok so he said complexHilbert space looks too much that's howit complicated in word space so theseare some of the main things that he hasdone in copying his paper okayunfortunately people got parity I don'tknow why so then we have to apologizeand so yeah obviously has to judgeCostanza if only people told me thiskind of nonsense so you put this up I'veseen claims that my new paper was partlyplagiarist it's as if I don't knowanything I same way is my projectsomehow other people Scott just gets init so this is true returns out and Ipocket I make the video on paper in oneweek to allow me to find two videos forBH schedule so if we each should haveset himself make it universe in one weekand he regarded universe in one becauseeverything is done in advance okayand he also said I hope to inspireothers I don't know what what what isone of us to do research this is a kindof research moving forward and thrown upand being more artful about my outputwhen we will change more phrases I mean- you know better sounding nonsensicalphrase anyway and I made that video onis such a nonsensical thing becausepeople spent years writing one paperpeople spend two weeks plus morecompleting the dam project that we giveyou okay if you're somehow able tocompletely just pound the deadline youare Serizawa without the followersunfortunately okay so I'm in a deep okaythey'll give you an easy way to learnthings there is one is able to learnthings if you think that is essentiallyyou can brainwashed by county watchingSara browse videos now this is what allof the heckuva see he's one of the guyswho's is vampires who basically sayshe's feeling Andrew stop ragging on poorstay large he once you say I'm sorrythis is the wall PDB you know you canscroll down and say sorry go to the nextclass the same thing I'm sorryunfortunately I just have this in thebeginning of the project okay so you sawsmall copy projects you can form andpeople will be parking about you in theprocess like this and if that's whatyou're working forcontinue but nobody watches my videosthese are apparently a lot more dancingin court and they're only two minuteslong and made up okay that's fineprobably a meter but so I was okay so Iwas quite impressed yesterday everyafter we found several people haveessentially assumed that we have takentigers so I told you that names and nothave an entire last page which I'm notshowing you but I do have faces todaythese are the chambers okay so obviouslyit's not even see this ending my clientby the teacherafter spending our time final step ofthe exambeing finding out that so many isworking on essentially with using asystem and the motherland is respectingthe work that the GS are doing that isrespecting all the other people in thisclass who will actually play by therules young samurai I'm saying it's noteasy from there and so dare to havefamilies they to have lots of trinketsof course work they to have every damnthing that all of you who had cheatedwould come up with other examples okaybut they chose not to do it and you arenot in the grade school you are most ofyou are too dear seniors and graduatestudents so I will actually very thicktest because I spent like the first theday before early yesterday morning wefound the first is happened I wasfighting about how I get more time fromyou guys teaching is teachingthere's no okay actually I do know thatwhile there is a whole bunch of peoplewhich he did they also have other peoplewho are played by the rules for exampleis a character who spend the banana isbefore the exam going through everyvideo that I recorded Netflix bingewatching replaced by a law bingewatching okay and put annotations onvery each of the concepts are in thisyou did have to do this with just anylater somebody beaches and this morningI woke up I got a comment on the sorrymonkey never oh my god one more somewines are going to say if only our storethatI don't want to see please give me thisand turns out this is my comment wouldyou please tell us how what you'reteaching relates to your articlesresearch okay now clearly this persondid want to give their name becausethey're afraid of being tarred andfeathered rest of you guys right so I Iteach ultimately without there arepeople who actually pay attention and asI told you I don't have to teach thisclass and I'm sure you don't have totake my class either there are many manyother ways okay I don't stop you fromchipping in your life but for you tothink that you think she'll invite classhow my my one of my students say is thatI say so many jokes that people thinkI'm an easy guy so the people who didand this is only for those people arevery sorry for other people who had togo through this but I want you to dothis other man cheaters this is a signof respect to you I actually preparedfor this class and I'm going to teach aclass because of you because of thepeople who actually pay attentionbecause of people who take it seriouslyirrespective of whether or not people goaway okaythat's thatokay so I'm going to quickly let youwhat they were doing plus for us aboutabout tsunami this quickly because bythe end I want to get to multi layer andI just hope that people will come backokay we are reinforcement learning thatis actually at the edge afterstate-of-the-art this is a guy fromwhich initial over killer of China it'slike the biggest right shareorganization the Dei group head is GPTwho used to be my colleague here he wasactually a professor here and there is agroup there's a lab for now in and thisguy Tony chain is working there and hetalked about how to use reinforcementlearning for in right sharingapplications figuring out you know howto dispatch what rights to okay so it'svery interested in some applicationdirect application reinforcementlearning which you would have areasonable chance of understanding eventhe discussion we have made here youmight show up tomorrowokay so we put on TV then startedtalking about reinforcement learning inthe new state space that means featurebased representations and then you havea base to presentations and instead ofupdating the values when you do eitheryour temper update several lurking atemporal difference learning are the keylearning you might have updating thevarixgiven to the features when you assumethat you are considering the value to bea linear weighted sum after featurebanners right that's what we did okayand then we talked about the question ofcourse is how to change the weeks andthe way to change the weightsit turns out some is actually the wrongslides the slides that I should havecopied over are the ones that change theweeks using the gradient update ruleright because these were the ones forthe atomic version okay so the way tochange that they include that the weightshould be in terms of the weight updaterules and we talked about how theweights can be minimized by looking atthe fact that the weights are a vectorvalue vector and you need to minimizethe error such that you know you want toset the range such that ever betweenwhat you predict is the value and whatis the actual value of the cell Winesapt minimized so it's a function of whoseminima you're trying to find and to findthe minimum function you get thecalculus you start doing the reduce youbasically take the differential and ingeneral if you want to just directly getthe minimum you take a difference readequate it to zero and solve for it butin most cases you can't solve theseequations the derivatives can actuallybe non most formal can be actually quitecomplex even if they respond and so youcan directly solve them so instead youdo small steps in the directionfrom the gradient if in fact you aredoing descent which is your try tominimize and you go in the oppositedirection if you're trying to domaximization okayin the ever minimization you go gradientdescent in the maximum likelihoodmaximization which we'll talk about whenwe get to probabilistic interpretationof machine learning you would wind updoing a game asset okay fine so wetalked about that and one thing that wenoticed is that in fact what was beingfunded when you are computing the wavesyou know the basic set in the range suchthat this linear weighted sum - theactual values where is minimized that isbasically called linear regression andyou could have your linear regression interms of one unit where these are thefeatures and these are the weights ofthe features these weights are being youknow features are being multiplied bythe weights and they're being somethingand then they're being passed throughthe summer the semantic question iscoming up and that's how the perceptronis estimating what the values should beokay and what you want to do is resetthese waves using our approach you knowthe gradient is a such that what it isestimating for any future combination isclose to what x value is that'sbasically the regression and I alsomentioned that you could also make thisnonlinear here in particular you coulduse the same idea to do classificationwhere the classification would be youassured that you here weighted sum witha nonlinear function and we talked aboutyou know various kinds of pressures wetalked about a staff functions we talkedthe core sequence we talked about Idon't know whether you mentioned butdamage is another function and thenthere is also remove which is rectifiedagain you know these are all differentis in which you're making like a apartat this point you know I was sent outzero after this I mean stand up actuallyso it's a nonlinear threshold in factany manual function can be there and soif you do use this kind of thresholdingfunction in the last step there itactually becomes perceptron becauseoriginally a guy called Frank Rosenblattwhen I was born time he basicallyrealized that these kinds of structureswith this kind of a nonlinearthresholding at the end can be used toclassify things that if you give forexample you know here are the positiveexamples of good students here on theback students can you put em on you knowand we differentiate so that my describeis unit you can tell whether or not it'sa okay the question then would be thatbasically the features of the studentsare being input and the weights arebeing automatically computed by theperceptron learning them such thatoutcomes will always be typically haveone or a zero if it's a step functionright so have the difference betweenpacification and regression if theregression the outcome is a real numberin classification the outcome is acategorical non points basically Jesusis the best way to think about it rightand you people realize that the space ofintegers is not continuous the space ofreal numbers eats so calculus ratherwork for just integers let's keep thatin the back of your mind but anyway sothe integers are what you are using hereand you're getting approximate twoengineers by using with these nonlinearSchrodinger functions and in particularif you want to use a nonlinear thresholdfunction are the sigmoid function thenthis idea will come very close we havepretty well known ideaclassification card logistic regressionthe only difference would be not onlywould you use the white function as athreshold but you also change the lastfunction last function is what you'reminimizing nucleus Li we decided the MASis the error and we took the squarederror half of a squared error and weminimized it you know what the half ofthe squared error unrealisedif on the other hand you take what'scalled a cross center in Las which we'lltalk analytically but in essence itbasically assumes that what is supposedto come out is a probabilitydistribution and you're comparing it toanother probability distribution thetrue probability distribution okay andthey are trying to minimize the distancebetween these two probabilitiessolutionsnotice that the proper distributionshave of some uppers except they havespecial properties they actually fall inwhat's called a simplex which is asimplex is part of any space with thecoordinates of all the other pointssomewhere exactly one okay anyway so inthis particular case you could actuallyuse cross separately last and you coulduse require function and then you wouldhave perceptron doing logisticregression it's a different approachthat came from a different place butreally you can think of it as connectedto just you know you pleasantly it'slike a different function a plug in afriend okay so anyway so we talk aboutconnections between perceptrons andneurons very you knowsometimes because you guys do seem tohave you know you are the pregnancy totake active missions from other neuronsand they seem to keep them that's wherethe word gained in the previous namecomes giving essentially the extrashoulding behavior okay so originallywhen was this guy I would take thesetypes of units in the hey this lookslike great stuff you know now I shouldbe able to do everything that you wantstanding this is what you know I wasn'twas very happy on there are interestingfirst of all one piece you want torememberbasically currently your networks haveextremely easy to do breathe except theword Europe okay it's like the otherthing that genetic algorithms hasbasically the word charity and somepeople will fall for it essentially andso it's like a Santa Fe and analogy buthere is the real neurons don't do mostof the things your own a question wewill keep talking about this multipletimes okaybut the analogy has helped people incoming up with ideas okay like in Europeit actually is it okay and most ofneurologists basically still do notagree but our bodies don't go yourscientists don't know how the day what'sin it so it helps becauseyou have no idea at least we havesomething that you're watching so okayum anyway so you remember thisdistinction if you what other last P isour part of the review that I want tomention is in addition to having a fewtailed the octet rule meet update rulesfor the revealed addition I also showedyou how people have computed the weightupdate rule a perceptron which is usingseen any thresholding function lets asigmoid function G of X and it's usingour MSM the Miss Vedaalamos actually is our one thing hookedme okay if you minimize this forever youalso minimize but you know we getthrough this and then that's one of thelast things I did for great and thething you want to remember about thesekinds of divisions they're all the samethey are all essentially wider usingchain rule of differentiation they justuse chain rule of differentiation you'retrying to compute the differential afterever with respect to some point in thiscase of it right and what you wind updoing so in this particular case this isthe error and I want to compute thepartial derivative of this error withrespect to the Jade feet and that isthat tells you how much the Jade whiteshould be changed the negative of thattells you how much the jth iteration iswhat I'm saying and so one of theproceedings is when you got this yourealize that it is connected to us owhich is the error term itself G - whichis the differential of a sortingfunction rightand I Jthe input corresponding to the weightinterestingly if you remember this willalways be sort of true even when you goto multi-layer backwards you wind upseeing it there will be an error partthen the G - corresponding to the shoresdifferential and they would be somethingas finding them the input the only thingkeeping you a little bit is then youhave multiple layers I know that we havespecifically family that summer therebefore here that really puts our campwhich standard become intermediate layeractivations which then our effect in thefinal level so as far as this guy isconcerned its imports are actually theactivations of the previous layerso in fact each rafter ie term you willwind up having the editorthis is how there are only so as far asyou're concerned you can be sure thatthat's how Canadians will look butsomebody has to have proved it once sowe will prove it today for a two layerednetwork but then having proved it wewill point out that since everybody hasbecome a patient and nobody wants tolearn anything first bit from firstprinciples and after all everybodyexpects I mean that number of emails Iget from high school students sayingthey want to go straight up are theyresearch anybody can do it or them rightit's just amazing I don't know what'swrong with you guys spend hours andmaybe emails saying maybe you gotweekend down a separately high schoolstudents are thinking anybody can do andthen they say anybody can do they don'tknow what the heck is it necessarilygiving some better suppose they do butmostly they don't but they go how tostart axial flow put in some numbers andwas time to plot and especially thereare science fairs you know this is myunfortunate that I know I'm a cynictoday but if you go by the sciencefields answer has been has beenbasically cured about every year aboutten thousand times if you look at thesign square things you know this littlegirl this little boy cure cancernext year they came they get to cure it
