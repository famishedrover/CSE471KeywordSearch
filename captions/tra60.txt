so I think that stuff you don't needjobs they can you fail and you're allstuck here so I didn't know someundergrad said they have to go to Garyeffects I should remember yeah it's sounfair that some people get to gosometimeso what I am going to do is aboutresearch and the interesting thing is abunch of ideas get connected withentries in particular something that younever thought would be connected whichis online computation which is you areable to do work during the time when youare also supposed to make a move versushaving done you are thinking before andhe just came to play without having toworry about thinking during the game andthe min/maxreasons that we looked at for examplethey do essentially are myinterpretation right because they lookat they decide what they what movieshould make they make the book they letthe average make a move and then figureout what do they make and they'repeaking at a time they are thinking intheir head about the moon that they aresupposed to make and this is onlinecomputation why this is happeningthe clock is ticking right which is whyin fact there are different kinds ofchairs for example lightning chanceversus more inches money powerwhich is basically Grandmaster sayswhere it's that if they have a lot oftime to make their move and there's atotal amount of time for that they takefor making all their moves is fixed okayso one of the interesting things thatonline computation please to be easythat there is only so much time and inthat time you have to decide how much tothink how much react okay and it becomesquite hard in normal types ofcomputations that you have seen up untilmouth film and computer science most ofthese computations essentially takesforever of take their whole time andwhen they terminate they terminate andthat's when they give the answer if youstop them in the middle you get garbagethey say what I'm saying on the otherhand so those kinds of computations areextremely hard to use while in an onlinefashion because they essentially takeall the time you don't know how muchtime they take they take our faith andif you happen to stop them a millisecondbefore they are done to get garbageright the advantage so so what you wouldlike to do is something like an ad timecomputationand anytime computation is a computationthat gives you an answer whenever youstop it it should give it more time yougive you a better sense you give it evenmore time inhibit even better answerhopefully the idea is that in fact whatyou really like to hope for in this istime this is quality of solution whatyou really like to have are things thatgo like that how comes which as you givethem more time they give more qualityokay you certainly don't want afterlimbs with Stata go down as more time isrevenge that's right and but mostly whatyou typically find up having is actuallyalgorithms which are like this sothey're basically made some of thisstuff get stuck in some place make itmove that stuff in some range making amove and stuck in some place etc thereason this is used followed the Kappais remember at the end of last class aswe were leaving the class towards theend of the class we essentially pointedout we essentially pointed out okaythe feud with max essentially wants youto go all the way down the tree untilyou find terminal nodes for anythingother than simple games that tree wouldbe very to large that they would be waytoo large and in fact you cannotactually in fact generate and it's youknow figure out your optimal modelbecause of the size of the tree soinstead what we did was we said we coulddo a heuristic min max what's theheuristic we match that's limited depthmin maxand what limited that with Mac sales isI just arbitrarily become a dancer andlearning expand the tree after that themokay of course are not expect I'll bestill expanded in the depth-first searchfashion but whenever I have reached thatdepth then I won't put more children insomehow I kept eliminated that firstsearch now we will depth limited minimaxwill therefore search right you're doingthis and of course there are twoquestions that for that we arediscussing in the last class versus notif I stopped in arbitrary places myperiod is not in a terminal state Idon't quite know what its value nice soI need additional piece of informationcalled an evaluation function which SATAtakes the gain position right now Itells me how unities okay and theterminal nodes actually know that realvalue but everything else is a unityokay and so these evaluation functionsare going to be used and I want to speakin a minute about the evaluationfunctions but as I'm saying this anytimenotion computations the big question inthese kinds of things is how muchsuppose to put the depth for the depthlimited search how am I supposed to knowwhere to shop do you understand what I'msaying and that's what happens in theneck limited search to now for thatlimits the rich I can give you a kid andI just happen to know that all the goodsolutions are have our kids then you canjust basically search depth limited andthat's what search within that ethnic atree okay however in this particularcase I I want to use the same idea clearso the way we expanded thatthat's our solution jcbeep an examplesearch is be kidnapped and then we gotover there and then pick another DEATHand keep moving this I can do this formin max so depending on approximate ideahow much time I have to make you movelet's have it quick for class after thatthat means two times I get to make amove two times the opponent makes it andthis is the only thing I'm going toconsider at the end of 4k I consider allthat l other nodes and consider theirevaluations okay evaluation functionokay now it may be that I can talk veryfast and I still don't have to make Wowyou know I don't have to actually makethe move right now you know so insteadwhat I can do it at that point I keepthis move and expand the depth two lexes6-1 and redo the whole search in it justlike it really opening that first searchokay we get a new move this time now tokeep this move and if it's time you takethis move it's not expanded to eighto'clock I would argue this is a kind ofat any time computation right becauseyou always have a move you're justimproving outer core the quality of moveif I give you more time I'm drinkingthis up because you have never thoughtof any time computations in your lifeprobably before coming to this classbecause you've been told an algorithmhas a normal termination criterion andthat's itso I'm asking what happens to algorithmwhen it hasn't yet terminated what isits intermediate States learned and isitlikely to actually improve monotonicallyon some property in this particular caseI am looking for the property of thequality of the movie quality of themorning right okay so these things areso disconnects the anytime stuff that Iwas mentioning in the previous light andit's all online computation I'm talkingabout any time computation now about howto increase the depth a little at a timeokay so it combines both of those butbrings up two additional questions oneof course something that we alreadystarted answering last class which iswhere do you get these evaluationfunctions other other you just took itfor granted when I said the deeper thebetter why is it should be reasonable tosay that if you go deeper in a searchtree it's still not enough it justhumanics off four five and six ninethese have six player and a plan okayand you did the search in that case whyis it actually the case that you expectthe quality limit is this some sort of afundamental property of nature thatdifferentiated is there something elsegoing on keep that in the back of yourhead and let's talk a little aboutevaluation functions now okay so wetalked about this evaluation function wefound which is basically keep thisremember the structure of the evaluationfunction all these are about evaluationfunctionsassume that if the state is a terminalstage you will recognize it you shouldnever play again him then you don'treview one it's like you know if you seeone however one have I won and you'reasking your opponent a parent will saynot yeteven when they have no pieces left andyou have all the pieces that is a notyet not yet because I'm importing morepieces because you are a clueless guyand so like to take away my point beingthat I assume at the minimum you couldknow a terminal state when you see oneif it comes and bites you you say ortimorouslyso all the validation functions shouldbe able to see if it is a terminal stateand if it is a pin formats give it plusinfinitylots formats give it minus infinity inthis particular case if it's a track Igive it a 0 as a value this is theminimum every evaluation function doesand if it's none of these then it's acase when it's not a signal state thenyou just do some you know hand-wavywhich is in this particular case youcounted the number of columns diagonalsthat are open for max minus number ofrows/columns/diagonals that are open forme right and that is it reasonablemetric of how good the how good the foodis for the maximum exposure agreedthat's it possibly valuation 1 and as Isaid for other things like chess thenmaybe evaluation functions like here iswhere you think in terms of features ofthe board that you think are connectedto win-loss probabilities and you sortof give some waves and this happens tobe some sort of a linear heuristicfunction but this time you Sokkarealized that evaluation functions areplacardthat means you don't exactly know howgood a moment evaluation questions usabait's Santa like you missed except it'snot even like a statistics in fact oneof the excuses are the evaluationfunctions supposed to be missing whatdoes it basically give me we don't talkabout a law in fact in relative actuallyit just gives an approximation of howgood the poor position is static okayit's kinda nice that after spending allthis time I wanted visibility in esta wecome to harder life which is thisparticular be a mystery search and thatanything goes you know in the end if youit's like a good idea it's not it's abad ideayes well personally I basically used insleepy because the membership sort ofmakes sense if if I put 1 and minus 1 inthe previous case specially the numberof rows columns are has opened for max -the fun for mecan you greater than 1 so that meansthis partial position is been betterthan me which makes no sense that thesepeople will stop playing game alrightthat's why I put plus infinity minusinfinity so basically what the bus everyday managing but it should be the ideastill ever worst values the game cannever take in the true terminal nodesand you should make sure that evaluationpanel doesn't cross there because wetrust them it makes no sense rightthat's the reason I quote Russellinfinity Madison it's a good questionand it's what were thinking about thoserecipes right okay so this is my godthis is actually the case which sort ofbrings us face to face with two kinds ofresearch that was done in dealing withthese kinds of games okayand if I'm right let me justokay so there are two kinds of researchthat was done in the older daysbasically in like 1997 when deep bluewon over Kasparov the evaluationfunction was hand designed chess expertsbasically designed the evaluationfunction they decided what are the goodfeatures they are also more or lessdecided what are the waves there was nottoo much automated learning going oninstead they focused on search doingsearch blindingly fast and in fact atthat time they had people differentpeople working on chess programs somepeople will try to improve theirevaluation functions some people willtry to just improve the raw speed of thesearch and as it happened the people whoare improving the vast field of thesearch ones are doing better in terms ofbeating the grandmasters this is whatI'm saying and I mentioned this to youthat when we prove actually won theycame up with a an application-specificessing application-specific integratedsearch it essentially Amira's achievedwhose only purpose is to spit out bothpositions they come back castasexpanding the search tree is the childgeneration always so if I can generatechildren very fast and just like nowthere may be an app for itthey had a chip for it and the chipwould just generate chef's positionsvery much and you can question successbecause they beat it will be read aspower ending human dominance of chessonce and for all right okay and ofcourse the interesting thing is that youcould say no that's not fair that's whythis whole notion of answer comes in inaddition to kvl unfair keeps on sayingpeople don't do this kind of searchCasper Oh can just wine saying I don'tknow just like this I have much Ido practice and that's what makes meCasper that's what makes you a littlemachine interestingly people arguedthese arguments you know one of thethings I do when I go back is I willconnect you to to do our types of x bytwo-year professors who could havetalked to each other instead of writingthe effects x and one guy called DavidKeller nervous who you might remembernot that you number everything as theguy who's one of the computer scientistwho got a letter from of course you guysdon't even know who it isokay look at all of this up okay this islike initially I should learn somehistory at least the most recent historyso a detective Kaczynski was sendingthese letters which would contain bombsand also send two intellectuals and oneof them was David Gardnerit wasn't quite clear what now as anintellectual you got the bomb the bombwill be community lecture becausebecause only flight rules are getting itso it must have been the case thatcurrent lecture right so anyway so whatif development wrote an op-ed sayingthis is no AI this is not the veryintelligence box intelligence meanssomething completely different and toMcDermott who was actually an AIresearcher the amazingly smart guy whoactually retired now he basically wrotea rejoined there in your time saw quitea couple of days later and he's notreading both of them because this wholeissue of what easy intelligence issomething that keeps dog in thisparticular field after somebody leavesover you we say sorry that's not theright way of meaning okay and so thatwould be an issue okay so that was theway that wasin 97 what's going on right now is oneof the offical types in fact one way ofunderstanding it now did you do a lotmore offline computation learning theevaluation function in fact theevaluation functions what done has likeeven in the deep-blue time it was peoplewere sitting and kind of differentdifferent evaluation bodies now wefigured out basically approaches thatcan look at massive number of games andtrying to evaluate how good anintermediate position is in fact I willgive you before we are done to startgetting an idea of how to do that okayso in particular if I give you a badevaluation function and that you arequite into a node but then you also whenwe do it applied it to its children andthen propagate in using minimaxyou now have two values for this nodeone based on your you restrict one basedon this extra work that you did to theextent going deeper is better thisbacked up value is a betterapproximation to your true value thenwhatever evaluation function you came ofit I repeat this but this is a veryinteresting idea this is telling you howto convert computation into quality talkabout the attention into betterevaluation of interior nodes and if theytake this let's say you do if you don'tunderstand anything else understand thisway Fargo can be working which is it'sbasically doing this on a large scalefor large number of intermediate nodeconfigurations and it's improving itsvaluation for those right and then ithashing them maybe hash table wheneverthis particular more position comesI have spent like last seventeen hundredyears by the way that amount of timealcohol woody if you make the mistake ofa minute amount of your computersinstead of the deep blues servers soalas 1700 years I have nothing else todo I have you take the in deviate novalues now I'm just going to use them asthey value function and to build Macs infact it's circling with Max if it aslightly different idea which also wemight talk about called matica aboutresearch MC t which is the cycleaviation you know randomization andthat's what they want this time and bothof these are different means of doingwell in these games after some extent itdepends on what time do you have if youhave tons of timing beforehand you canlower than there is the evaluationfunction if you only have time after thegame starts this is the only thing youthink and these can be complicated theycan be combined together making senseok so that's one part that I want you tounderstand um so the other thing ofcourse is I want you to I start up setthis in the background but I want you towalk you down this it is basically themin/max cutoff the deeper you go and youmay say put the evaluation values tothat leaves notes and then you do moveit max with alpha beta only rememberalpha beta pruning doesn't ask where didyou get your numbers you just sayswhat's your number and then uses thosenumbers to compute the bounds to get thebars to kind of search right so itactually works irrespective of where youwent all the way down to the least knownoh you just went a couple of layers andapplied some random values you want okayI one of the interesting things is ifyou don't if you only have normal kindof evaluation functions like the obviousthings like number of pieces leftkind of evaluation functions the biggestdifference tends to be how deep were youable to go so in particular this oneobviously didn't like this particularsite was made about almost three yearsbackso before not follow then they werethinking in terms up we move unlesseverybody have the same kind ofevaluation function what they will dodifferently with the search faster wordsare slower in terms of that you okay sobefore I look ahead is a hopeless chessplayerprobably better than me but hopelessjust there okay for my basically some ofa human novice player essentially and afly is a typical PC seven years back aha human master so four to eight monthsalready human master okay 12 pi is thepure gospel 12 like that means I looksix of my moves and six of your movesI'm talking drum master level now whybecause I'm looking at be 35 that youpractice at if I purchase approximatelypower to 135 are twelve moves is whatI'm looking at that's the tree size gobees watch okay so in fact the pointthat they found was the people you whenyou're doing better and in fact thatreal differences between how far you canlook aheadso going deeper can also be conceived interms of looking ahead the reason I saylooking ahead is the following supposeyou are the max you have three movesyou have an evaluation function do youeven about doing research just a quietevaluation actually here let's say whichis the last minute this is essentiallythat one ply solution it's as good as avalet key value point you can pair backto something which was for time it'slooking ahead more into the number offeryou cannot worry to the number of nodesokayin general people have told you that thevote you do care the better you can planand that sort of working out here andthey're looking ahead you're lookinginto the back in Genesis or maybe you'lldo better okay my question actually israther keep this in mind so this isessentially that we need to think ofonline search so you are here you havethree votes Alexei you evaluate allthree booths I take the best move that'sit that's the greediest online search ifyou have more time you look at it you goon ahead and under this I got yourmovies so the more time you look at whatahead and then decide what your moviesin saying now this is we are sort ofsaying that the move you look at thebetter the quality of the movenow what actually do I mean by sayingquality of the movies betterwhat exactly do I mean by here is a wayof thinking about it the evaluationmarks online give these guys values thatsay this is for recently this is 4 thisis 7 the evaluation function gave thesevalues you feel fact you band all theway down to the terminal nodes and big 2min max okay let's say these are ABCsee maybe he stood regarding the value astar disregard the value B stardisregard of a nice Easter that's thetwo mid max values but I'm talking aboutquality I am talking about how to follow347 vector from a star B star C starwhen you see body a star B star C starwithout doing hollaback then you are notgoing to do any worse than the guy whoran all the way to the diamond this iswhat we mean by quality so it's all thein terms of backup values and how goodare the backed up values as you godeeper what sets your up front wellacross nation and in general these arenot achieving the deeper you go thatmost of this vector would be the vectorthat you get after you go in deeper thatmay be exactly four seven it might benine eight you're assuming that 298would be closer to a star B star C starthat's what I mean by saying deeper insecond so the question is why is thistrue why is actually this true it's easyto believe in the more you look at thebetter you do but haven't you havesituations in your life will be partlymore longer and you actually walked upfeeling it happens so the real questionis these are two possible answers whichis the right answerso answer one says taking mins and maxesof the evaluation function remember justgoing deeper and you're not going to letme tell them nor you are using the sameevaluation functions except at a lowerlevel so instead of saying number acrosscolumns diagonals open - max - number ofrows from triangles over to me as alevel one andwhy is this computation somehow tellingme more about how good the Modi's andI'm doing it at level 4 Danny did when Iread the same a computation level onethese are the answer questions you haveto ask yourself rightand so one idea might be that maybetaking the mins and maxes of theevaluation values at the leaf nodesimproves their collective accuracy butthis is the kind of argument that makessense and somehow you take some numbersthe same or bad numbers but somehow I'vetaken you know mins and maxes which isan aggregation of some kind and that'ssomehow improve their quality that's onepotential reason a second ideait turns out actually that this is abozo reason it's just Martin okay infact it can establish students you knowthat if you want to estimate a quantityestimate it directly don't estimate itby taking the pieces that comprise thatquantity okay I'm teasing estimateddirectly your errors are likely to beless than if you aggregate because whenyou do the aggregation whatever speed upso in fact this is the cardinal sin instatisticsI put this here because this looks likea very reasonable thing many people whohave 37 a reasonable reason why it'swhat the actual reason it works is adifferent possibility which is by goingdeeper you might notice some obvioustraps Ratana which the evaluationfunction then bathtub becomes better sothe idea that I'm saying here is I wentto this launch search tree and I'mapplying ravage function here but whenI'm coming here there are nodes heresome of which I can see a definitelosses for max one of the mostinteresting things about human games isthey may take a long time to win butthey take very we try to lose thisyou're insane you can lose chess in likecouple of moves like for five news youstart on this ejectment and the otherI'm slowly getting used to like threefour day game
