connected if you're working on Monteyou're losing time another after Wagnermoney you probably may not be able towhat kind of sometimes working on onething allows you to make progress on thesecond goal to this you're insaneso for example I might have I also wantto have a cheese steak which is verystrange before me you have become avegetarian when I wanted okay these areJews of course but once how cool is itbecause of work if I want to go toPhiladelphia then I will basically havemore or less whatever I need these areinsanein that case you think these arepositive interactions of course arepositively attracting working on onesupposes helping you make progressnumbers of negative interactions betweensupports to the extent some of youprobably for one thing really to be oneor more exam it's not probablynecessarily because you don't want tolearn because I don't know why that isparty that classically but becausethere's only so many hours in the dayand you have other things to do and youhave to prepare for the exam but sothere is negative interaction that iswhat were that works and you're alwaysmaking these hard choices in generalokay now this is done even if the rewardfunction scenarios it's just that it'smuch less clear that if the trade-offsare much less clear whereas if you thinkin this high level you realize thatthere are a straight up shop and thesearch strategies actually make thosetrade-offs in making the search processin one dayso some cool interactions which issomething that we think of naturally infact in a minute I'll show you thisDilbert example which in my favoriteexample is the mutually exclusive gohappen you know and then basically youcan't do everything you know you havethis apart and sometimes the positiveand the besties independent alphabetsare different different okay in whichcase planning a scale you know one ofthem I already mention is actually thespirit and Rover mast rovers Spirit andOpportunity they wind up using a lot ofthis kind of writing planning operatorsbecause there are experts who actuallyknow what are the conditions that mustbe exposed to before the action what arethe conditions that will be assertedafter that and they can use that anywayyou can also use it all sorts of crazyother applications for example anotherone second one is imagine you have aparticular system and you're trying tothink of how many different ways peoplecan break into the system each way ofbreaking in corresponds to a particularplan of attackyou want to opponent model you areessentially trying to think of all theplans thatcan be and then make sure none of thoseplans work this is what I'm saying soyou can convert cybersecurity problemsinto generating our plans for aparticular goal such as break into thesystem and then stopping each of thoseevents okay so basically and then thisone is kind of interesting for some ofyou probably for quite a long time I'mnot completely sure I'm not a gaming guybut for quite a long time essentiallymost of the game software when they havea DI inside in fact the word AI beingused as a nounI didn't know when I basically was okayand then what do you have my schemestarted saying and then they I did itand I use doing stuff because in thegame there is this game a eyes and manyof you probably thought of AI first timethat way okayand from minigames these AI have come upwith reasonable ways in which they arebehaving okay and you keep talk aboutthe background you are essentiallytalking about that what will you do at acomic level in many games back in somecase this particular one you can look upthe designers job would be to createenvironments that allow the AI toshowcase their behaviors and thedesigner won't strip the behaviors thebehaviors of this will searched using astar search are one of these techniquesare youand so you write the designer basicallywrites the actions that they acted sothose kinds of things again you canstart thinking that I really don't knowanything about the world all that needsto be done the AI has tofrom scratch okay after some exchangethat's like the pendulum swingingcompletely the opposite way you do knowhow to work in many domains and you alsodon't know what community and you needmore time something and you know thenyou know something and this is a teenyou gotta mention multiple times in theclass especially where the tacitknowledge remains you should try towrite actions perfect to seek knowledgedomains you should try to sneak any Ifigure out what I already know this isnot giving you giving a twist to theyeah and then okay so you can't just saylet's just send spirit to mark succeedwe can figure out it's too costly yousee what I'm sayingokay so that's an example of that sothere are these types of planningcommunity it was this is a white backactually I don't know what they releaseright now the guys I don't know how manyof you know the original CD was mostlyscripted okay and so basically the guyswho did CV then went on to talk aboutthe ability to for any have to beinterface into the chapel and to be ableto sequences of actions and by Samsungthis has to say there are scenarioswhere you know what about the domainsandand like the language model and thenmachine with them so we talked aboutwhen you have you know things in thisform you can affect form the my clothesrequest will be as I said the idea wouldbe that you don't need to separatelywrite a new Chinese generator functionand you go test function for each domainthese would be schematized childgenerator both test functions that willjust work for domain so the question ofcourse then is it turns out that even atthis level you can actually then talkabout different kinds of searchstrategies okay it's a star search whatare you going forward in the space ofstates are you starting from the initialstate going to words a state where allthe ghosts are true ahare you starting with what you want toachieve and reasoning backwards actuallywith and that's the backward easily anda third thing of course is actuallyblowing those two we talked about at theend of last class which is basically oneis progression one is regressionregression is pretty obvious theequation is already slightly spooky andthen I'll talk about plan-space planningwhere you say what I finally want he'sat land not the state what a plancan you get me to the state so why am isearching in the space of states eitherforward or backward modernistis a plan Saturday come on I start tocommunity I'll plan and see is italready right if not I will try toextend it one way around so the closestthat you can think of and I just saidthis is remember for the shaft problemswe could do systematic search but SAPproblem is one more of the problemswhere the solution is the only thingthat matters the order in which you madethe assignments doesn't matter so in thesystematic search you try to think interms of the order in which you make theassignments right whereas in the CSATwash em remember 30 SEC was a simplerversion that you essentially start withan assignment and see if you are luckyenough that is already correctif not then you start flipping beads andthen you are doing the 20 in that casethe in climbing was in a space forassignments it's a space of completeassignments so you can also do the endof an idea you'll find in all systematicsearch directly to the space of classesso the progression is easy enough inthis particular case you basically ifyou have become it and then basicallyyou remember that we carry aunfortunately multiple slides backyou know so so and if you do this thenyou know you can essentially write onecharge a function which of thisirrespective of the domain URL and thenyou to stop that the whole test functionwill be if you stop as soon as itreaches a state where the goals ofalready and for our if I over correctlythe walls were not a billion handle andyou can convince yourself but if you gofrom here and then after a bit of a ifyou stack a and B from this state youwill get the next stage which will begoes to then the question would be whatis the shortest path of their actionshave asked what is the cheapest to askfather that we know a starso that's tumbling progression randomthe regression is an interesting oneagain actually here actually in the caseof revision I'm starting from the goalsthat I have I want to make sure that Vis not clearedI want to make sure that hand is inthat's it then I can start thinking ofwhat I choose not to have in the plansuch that this really world so inparticular I will actually do this youknow last action what should be the lastaction yeah okay so imagine put downfirst of all let me ask the followingthing can that would really be the lastaction because in search ever considerall actions as a hospitalist action so aperson is either be a quantity of astash why notbecause if you complete one of its FHwould be would be F it should be clearbecame one of its effects will beclearly what you want not clearly to betrue if this is the last action it is nomore time to so we stick let me dosomething more no this is no actionthis is what I'm sayingso you can handle by saying put down wecannot even be the last action this planshould be will be twice that's niceand you didn't try this launch becausethis in fact you can believe that butessentially what we're saying is you canonly replace the state over an action ifthis action has effects about consistentwith the script consistent it's not evenconsistent because that's why you wonderon the other hand you can't go down herebecause put down is effect would be anice clear that's okay and handles MPthat's completely okay at which pointyeah my question is this is the firstaction before this action so I thencompute the state before now see theseare states is misusing them these arepartial States right because there areactually nine state variables and ddqto first balanced or all of thecommunicator but somehow so they couldbe many many states that are consistentreadings so partial state really thesemantics is that it's a set of statesokay and then and you this you get outof state upstairsit me nicely do this me but it'sactually responding to each okay so youreplace would be that when you dump acan be done then you see if it is evenanything useful here it is given hadn'tso then I don't mean Hannity here butits marketing okay so somebody else herethis is like you doing this is yousaying hey I can handle deep but then Ineed emptied so you take care of therest whatever you feeling as part of theruse am say to be able to do what I'msupposed to do you need to give me aright that means you that this actioncan have it precondition itself so thisaction put down it has a precondition asa recording so you write any polls arenot supported by the action plus all thepreconditions of the action under symbolhere is reduced a can be then you getover the air and p.m. because a KB wouldgive you not really because ing I'm nothere okayand after sake in the hand will be ableT so it also get the entity so in factif you stock a be will give both bothnot clear beep and handed the only thingyou will require that in extremeconditions right an expla conditions areholding a.m. to every unit goes to themso this is a guy where is all the ballsyou justthis is goodthe question is when do you stop youstop them any of these partial stingsare already working in the initial statethat's itone of the initial series just likeyou're going from initiative or satoutside the understanding from the goalstate initial state hereyou think if whatever you need in theinitial state is already through thanyou enoughokay so that's basically what thebulliest says evolution has to bestopped and everything in the outer skins - pores in the initial state aside inwhich case whatever you like to satisfyhow they get to the interstateyou say I'm grounded now the plan thisway how do i execute the plan still thisway see what I'm saying this is whatplanning is all about you can think inthe backward direction but you alwaysexecute in the power direction justbecause you're executing in the forwarddirection doesn't mean you have to thinkin the power direction yesthe question then is which is betterthinking for more English backwards whatdo you think so this progression patternof Accession better so here is aprogression idea is regression ideawhich one is betterso it turns out there are possible to doreason first my probation is good and Ican also give you reasons as to why theywish this and it becomes an empiricalquestion okin particular in the case of regressionregression has a lower branching factorbecause fewer actions are likely to getrelevant to the polls you have damnactions that can be done in the stateyou are when you make it in the morningnumber of things that you can do rightthen as the first action is potentiallyinfinite but your final goal is to be inthis class so if you start consideringthe entry tranching fact of all theDalida then you can do and theefficiently telling you can additionallymedium you can do and then see any oneof these really tiring paths lead to theclass that would be a very inefficientsearch instead you can see somebackwards I have to be in at 1:30 andthen I'm trying to say what should I bedoing now maybe rush it is you're insanethat's the backward direction so thatlooks like a reaction so of course it'snot as possible to come up with alogical domains where branching factoris higher in the forward and low in theforward direction than the backwarddirection but if mostly about remainsyou expect sighs progression searches inthe space of complete states so in thisparticular I said there are mine verymy proposition for their group onlinestates so 506 how many states how manypartial states that are there for thedigression on research we talked aboutit as far as its three power and whybecause in every state and it will canbe present positively because I want itto be positive the go straight untilbecause it negatively which means everystate variable has three options whichmeans the three power and partial stairsthe ability should not be surprisingpartial States on a superset of Catholicstates as a complete state is a specialcase of a module state business companyis a fantastic a complete state with anine state variables are given values inthis building anything less than mystate variables being given values is apartial state so we set of partialstairs is a superset of just copies ifyou look at it back with it looks likelicorice is appallingokay and in fact you can come up withrevision but neither one of the problemswith regression is that you can be atthis partial state and you expand itfurther and further and further and thispartial state responds to some set ofreal-world states right that's acommunityif that set is empty that means there isno real world state that responds tothis worship state the question is youbelieve that here they release this gamelike that in fact again those of you inthe class so it looks like both of thesecan be taken backward for that butconsider this one not pure breed andholding it not clear beyond ordinary isthe problem that I gave you where herewe are on the table hand is a deal iscan you ever reach a state from thatstate where P is not cleared by themolding thing as I said maybe it's notthat this problem is inconsistent it'snot the reason the state is notinconsistent but it is unreachableeither the state that you thinkgood-looking state and you realize yourealize in some region and so then youwill it's the state is not reachablethen you replace the state or some otheractions you get more states you thinkyou know me it's just like that right wegot more networks who then will be geteven more attacks the way you die insearch is that guys have each othertruly true this is exactly what you havetheir wide insertion so that you need tobe able to say hey already at that itwasn't obvious to most of you that thiswas not actually reachable in fact tosee whether a state is reachable thatway to solve it is now the panel andthese are the goal and if it stays thatis a hydrometer is you're insane it hasspecial cases where unreachable it canbe computed cheaper but if you want tocompute unreachable it is exactly it'san extremely and in fact in many manydomains not just in planning this wholebunch of other you know model checkingcertification etcetera they all careabout this particular problem ofreachable States and you can't come toget exactly eventually you might be ableto compute upper and lower bounds with aset of reachable States okay in whichcase is you're not even enough for foundof states then you're certainly notreaching this is actually becomes veryimportant in running problems in factthat in the extended session I'll talkaboutsomebody who actually started selling apuzzle problems we tiles and spotthey're physicaland then he grows the buzzer and itlooks like it should be possible to itonce you swap it you can go into a spacethat is disconnected from the space URLso none of the actionsand if you can exactly is just beautifulyou can actually search basically whatwe want to talk about is that since theend what I want is a plan I can startthinking in terms of partial plans whatis the partial plan a partial plan hasthe beginning state organizationbeginning actually initial state whichis a table reaction which essentiallydoesn't require anything at leasteverything that's true the initiated asacceptance and then there is a vast sinkaction from bold action which doesn'tgive anything out other than timeand it has three conditions than thosethat you have and you put a plan sayingthis and this and some stuff in themiddle figure out what is the scuffiethat we do such that when you executethem if you do it that way thenessentially you will be using for thesearch mode so for the search form as acomplete state for the Depression wasUltron was a partiality for plan spacesearch the search mode would be apartial plan and a partial plan will bea set of actions with residencerelations between them it's a partialordering between so that any completetotal order first and the partial isplus there are causal links somebookkeeping telling you who is in whatto move okay and the generation of theplan would essentiallykeeping that what I did me I need tohave somewhere you could give me I
