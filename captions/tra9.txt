so you want to have okay as I said Iwould most of our different ways thatworks weekly and discrete variables infact mostly boolean variables but as Isaid Bayes networks also what acontinuous variables we also havediscrete not boolean variables see whatI'm saying and in essence semantics arethe same at any given node I need toprovide the conditional distribution ofthat nodegiven my experience okay imagine I havesome network like this where every inhere all these numbers are real valuednumbers so the variable values are realcontinuous okay and I call this sigmoidbelief networks because my idea is thatfor the network for a node like this itsdistributionI need probability of I JI like probabilities to tables so youhave to present the distribution if youwant to participate exactly you have torepresent it as a function most of ourlives we presented them as rows formfunctions how many of you know the bellcurve gamma distribution okay Poissondistribution geometric seriesdistributions they're all essentiallyyou know roasts form analyticdistributions if the class distributionof the marks of a class doesn't speakthe bhagavan distribution as a noisenoise noise is still not it does becausethat's a good thing to feed okay but ifyou really want to capture all sorts ofcontinuous distributions in fact itturns out you need to have a moreexpressiveso they will get you out of your comfortzone of nama distributionkeep that in mind so in one pointessentially is in providing thisconditional distribution I could haveactually given this distribution has aneural net this is what I'm saying soyou want the probability you put inblack JKL values it has to be theprobability by what were you doing whatyou doing ossification this is howbasically to kind of mess with your mindsaying that everything isso that you won't lose anything okaywhy not bitching okay so that's thesecond part of course is imagine Iwanted to write this and I've decidedthis conditional distribution in acompact with we will talk about thisparticipate very much the idea is evendo it has three gatesI will assume that each of the variantsaffect the conditional distribution sortof independently of others so there arelike factors for each other variants soimagine a volunteer I will decide to usethis which is your or logistic functiona sigmoid function as the conditionalprobability distribution for this Lordgiven its various the funny thing iseach of those spirits are occurringindependently they the value of thevarying times associated with itnormally if you have three parentsconditional probability distributionshould have given it access booleanvariance additional propertydistribution should have eight rows eventhe boolean minutes the continuous okayinstead I just say I will basicallyassume that alien K and L are sort ofsomehow modulating their experience Jand L are not rating a difference onhigh in this nice way[Music][Music]in 2013 when people are it's too hard tonarrow networks so remember I told youabout hit thumbs force on Coursera whichis no longer a bit and he said well mostof it is still on is the page he willnot have or sigmoid belief networksmistaken I may even have a staticpicture from one of his legs and hisidea he's sixteen speak cannot actuallyclean that propagation because it's slowvegan phosphite to view it as a problemstick network and use the belief networkmethods which we will still learn alittle bit of that and then do itwithout youokay and that's how those things areconnected investors actually everybodywants to do media networks but none ofus are working should we just act as ifthere's some kind of specialized okaythat's useful copies of just to make yourealize that base networks can becontinuous and in fact everything wewill talk about for the rest of thetable I will talk in the discreteversion but in the back of your head youknow that there are textbooks but then abigger point is new networks I mean ifyou see his particular item sub beliefthat was they might feed forwardnetworks computed then one of the thingsthat have become clearer as we goforward is if you see this as a nicenetwork to make your life simple theylook exactly the samecomplicated right because what happenedwas notice what we did because we arepresenting the conditional distributionthis way each parent only each fader Ionly need to know the date it is goingto provide to this special okay and ifyou have that one of the interestingthings one of the mind-boggling thingseven if you view it as a base network ifI tell you something about thisthis present so is there adirectionality we cover I mean maybeit's not as obvious yeah this is thenext one - right it's not a simplenetwork this is a network and one of theinteresting things is if I tell you itis cloudy you can compute the problemaffect us if I tell you it is that crossis fair if we can find a probability of1 if I tell you it means we are abuse ofany of the variables you can compute thedistribution of the rest so is there anID for probability of the signal folksthey have generated you out of the boxif they important you know you know thisbusiness of you thinking this must bethis must be output is because you sendsomehow decided to think that nobodytold you that how he is they do what isjust a video so if you see usually is ifyou see this it looks like that theinputs outside outputs are decide andthe inputs will exchange the outputsnothing else but if you see the samething at the base network outputs willchange the emotion and that was actuallythe idea that in term was trying to dohe was trying to do something kind ofexpectation maximization algorithm whichwe will talk about it laterwhich is essentially if we are dealingwith neural networks with hiddenvariables that means variables arecannot we have a capsule you know notwork you can observe the very beginninginput values and the loss of couldmanage everything else is hereand you know it turns out that there isa great idea called expectationmaximizationwhich nobody is using this anymoreso you can it's the most quality teamyou would try to learn in your networkthat just captures that conditionaldistribution and then they say heythat's your network because you know youtry to look for some Gaussian goes onand on of ever where you found the otherhand you want to think of this workthing as a Bayes network and you canalso actually this particular giaspecified network essentially meansconditional distributions are allsigmoid functions there are sequences bythe way in days and some of the basementeither today end of natural period ofthe next class we will talk aboutsomething called noisy our institutionsand when you think I see our eat thisand we see nicely I think this noisy arttries to do but these 328 worms what wewere doing hereit tries to make the additionaldistribution more contact by makingadditional assumptions okay so somethingis the opportunity okay so this is stuffthat you should knowsuppose I told you that if I keep you atwork I can compute of constitution and Ikind of said you know the rightdistribution you can compute any promisedegree at least in efficient what youwant to believe that you actuallylearned this as part of your so theseare two take and the cavity you guysmight have some cockamamie theorythinking that who takes cause cavitiesfj's don't cause I can't estas to takesokay but anyway the point is thatkilling a full joint distribution that'show it works rightso can I answer any of these babies whatis the probability of cavity and in totake say what's the probability of candybecause cavity essentially is this isone page that candies truth is anothercase where it's cavities cavity is truewith to take me to cavity is true in thegreen box in general of when you do thatin combat what marginalization is yourLMC marginalization is the kind of thingproperty people hit becausemarginalization requires actuallysomething out our variables so thatleads us to the next position jokebishops are the only peoplemarginalized when they are because[Music]because it's to marginalize a chinois tointegrate and has to choke okay so hereis oh rightwhatthis is property of this one the secondone property is cavity is cavity givento date and country given not with itand I have no structurewhat about that with it it's a simplenumbers ok 3.0 4.0 one cavity givencavity this is the thing that I'm a hugedeal but you know the answer by now Ihope you look at the textbook for thegfinity is argument as to why we shoulddefine it this way but what will thatdefine it as as probability of C inclass probably the end- probability of C a and you know thisnumber from here and you know thisnumber and you know this number just by8 we goright this is discrete robbery theoryyou should know thisI'm just trying to make sure that youkind of arrival okay um then the lastthing of course a robbery relapse yetgiven not herethat is my conditional distribution okayfor thought how do we do this webasically have finished that's like saythe past in database which means anyproblem okay um so you know thesenumbers we see in your life and you canyou know the P okay to get thisbasically youand in general you are always askingquestions probably one of the mostuseful places where progress revisitingfirst became popular at the time ofexpert systems medical expert systemsand the case of medical expert systemsthere are two kinds of things largelyspeaking there are symptoms and thereare diseases there are also in betweenthe symptoms and somehow seem to believethat diseases are symptoms now it's notGod's what diseases customers butwhether or not you have a diseaseoftentimes ending an OP see easier thannobody as they have to test based onyour symptoms to see where they gatherdo you understand okay now first of allhere is not very rustic question sobasically what you wind up doing isyou're trying to ask you know you havethese kinds of probabilities givensystem probability of system givendisease right why do you go to yourdoctorsokay so doctors basically now sinceyou're talking about this any numberswhich types of how easily they can fillthem up they give symptom given diseaseokay I'm missing many Turkish food clipsthis is even symptom numbers upknowledge about it okay how many I willbe very context books use symptoms evendisease most of you don't[Music][Music]so before I go I want to write thisthing now you go with probability you'reasking the doctor what is my property ofhaving a disease given that I have thischamber and the doctor has to answerthat using the other kind of problemssymptoms[Music][Music][Music]the statisticians believe is becausepatience as I said will saybut when is room is this if you justwant to show you this rule what itallows you to do is to answer questionsabout the agnostic probabilities thisone in medicine is called attack hasbeen using probabilities is your dancingbabies himself wasn't clear what isdiagnostic part is Casa is just easydoing algebra d7 say that space and thenyou have to understand and I'll show youa slightly better but you understand thereason is is because it allows you toespecially do the hard to finddiagnostic probabilities from inparticular even if you are not learningthese probabilities somebody's ifsomebody is estimating theseprobabilities the question would bewhich kinds of probabilities are morestable and which guys are less stable soas they're for validation is theprobability that few process he knowssuppose you check around with a bunch ofambience and I look at all the peoplebasically house[Music]so you with this probability that youcommunity will be probably is a verydifferent number in technique and it isindeed then it is income shape they aremean is demeyers but the other sidenumber is the same much more safe if youunderstand this causal probabilities arerobust so that's why textbooks try tocompute that causal probabilities ifthey know causes machine learningsystems have no idea what is that askwhat isyou don't know what is the carbon whatis the center so they are providing whatthey are actually know but in my caseand you happen to know these things thenyou're much better computing thousandprobability estimating the cutterprobabilities and using them to computea diagnostic this is quality a rule wasallowing you through and that's whyyou're so happyokay the other point of course is ingeneral I've been talking about this I'dlike the most useful most useful kind ofqueries the probability distributionpromised a grizzly is marked from theend we probably happy but it's probablyour ABC given des probability of somethings given some evidence so most ofthe and so in essence what obviouslyreasoning is trying to do is computingthese types of distributions inparticular you walk into the doctor'soffice what's the probability that youhave you just want to you did you'reover your mom didn't even look at youwhat's the probability that the priorprobability that random baby person hasokay so what I would say is theprobability distribution of flu and ifthe flu is actually can only be zero andone which is our kids what you can alsohave other continuous variables and inthe beginning you may have some sort ofpain
