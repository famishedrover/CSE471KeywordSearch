go to consider the hidden variable beingone value versus other value and sampleyour much invested in determine order tomarginalization it was summation adigression and you know who expounds Iknow you you probably like songs you hitvacations we hate ourselves who ate somelogarithms logarithms it stops therelove multiplications this one I'm sayingis the multiplication this becomes someafter the raggedy actually understandyou have a simple scenario they don'tknow ecology of the days network and theattributes of the guitar in which caseit turns out that irrespective of howcrazy the network is this one is notparticularly crazy however crazy thenetwork is you can be sure that all thepartial derivatives reach to anentangled patiencewhich means Doyle patrovita justbasically move in terms of theta so youget a net worth by go theta one will bejust in terms of theta one so if it is 0you get they get out gentlywhat's the best way of solvingsimultaneous equations X plus y plus Zyou must apply for something the bestkind of feminist equations are havethree equations are XY and Z to X equalthat's what you will get then you havethis network complete data and tabularwhich is the only things you do take inthat case all these equations will beeasy to south so let me show you this soessentially if you had actually in thehot version of this right[Music]huge expression religious thumbs andnotice that each piece only has one ofthe variables now if I do basicallydough this is a log likelihood partialderivatives so what is though theacidity of this with respect to theta itrespect to theta that they twenty ofthis is 0 this is 0 this is 0 it is youright so the only ones which have Jerryreviews will be the outer overdraftsequal to T by theta minusyeah that's what you know you say Iaddress you my name but now you know youknow this is right okay and similarlyfor to output of it a one it's only thisstuff we need is still dying this withthat right back at the partialderivatives of those two are series sothen once again for this guy it will bec plus minussee where I'm going now is like I wasshowing you thatlet's go back to the basicsJohn coughs really Gus if I can do thisrightI wanna do that that's a gentlenessdisconnect so if I actually set up sobasically the complete package for thiswould be each episode each eventif I give you 1,500 of these data pointsthen basically I'm doing this emptinesshere so then you can compute the PP byjust looking at all the data pointstotal and the fraction of them maybe istrue and say that is the and if you arethat will be exactly but in this wayokay and similarly for Allah for Allahbasically I need to compute what is theprobability that true given bubbly trueright so if I just need to compute thisnumber I forget all the samples take thesamples they both agree and have papertrue put that number in the denominatorand I want them see how many of them arealong the numerator right this iscompletely and it's the best ever happento your wife because the likelihoodexpression nicely becomes an entangledequations and I'm telling with linearequationsnot even any revisions the more generalcases pretty much after this anything itwould be actual linear simultaneousequations so rather than directly southyou would argue that is somehowaccidents if I could give you the actualnetwork then you can say well I'm doingBayes network of attrition by thestimulationsjust these five variables right thereare multiple different ways I canconnected we already found differentdifferent waysimagine if the b e:h here damn are youcare is better about many cops how youcan is do many powerI want but I don't come up with somekind of a network configuration thisnetwork configuration require you tounderstand how the send this works ifit's a random raid card transaction thatthey I don't know what connects to whatso what I will do is rather than Oh withthis network and say you know don't giveme the topology I'll make up onetopology for everybody's Almeidacapacity so you want Mary and everybodyelseif you said whatever you get me aboutthis month don't get me a book I havebut anyway naive Bayes classifiers sayyou don't need to cue us knowing howthis debate actually worksthis topology should make your good boythinking what posionous is this anambien cr general an experiment that'snot the way the real world works how doyou know how the new world worksyour makeup Tommy in which case ninedays pass pass obvious your attributesthat we have connected to the class thenit just becomes a very simple sub casecomplete in the various networkparameter estimation and it involvesessentially if you could do this we dothis because we just make thisfor them you just count the number ofyou know you this kind of a teamI need what is the probability of themwhat's the probability of D what's theprobability of E and then what's theproperty cap n will given in happensjust right and so actually in fact hugemistake um it's actually the specific[Music][Music]because so um this is scenario two andyou realize how bad this so when youactually take another problem and you donow is possible even expected the secondidea is to try and actually learn andpop ologies which looks like a greatidea but for the fact that you have tobe careful it turns out that if youconsider a network n another networkwhich is M plus some moreyou can convince yourself in easily thatthe more densely connected so thedegenerate case would be everybody thenif everything is too many parameters isalready so then what you'll see is nofun topologies that also wind up with Ijust maximizing the likelihood of thedata but at the same time minimizing thenumber of just like even all that whatyou say not only we might have asked butsomething that goes next class alsomention what happens when for example Igive the data with some of the variablesvalues BC which is
