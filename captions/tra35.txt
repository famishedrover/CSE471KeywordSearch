these pictures on here so this is thepicture that weird a lot of news inmarvel at one point of time last year orso we're basically in our Fiji aquaright-wing bozos we're putting this onthe Facebook this picture and say oh mygod Nami is being taken over by putaclad Muslim women we need to stopimmigration maybe build a Ford orsomething okay this is what was going ondo you see some of you probably see butthen you must see so my point is humansalso really visually wrong theclassification sometimes but if you areif you did look at it carefully and usepart this was a burka carcass removalthe moment I said any bullet actuallycity was seeds as a mixer sorryanimation now I'm showing you and yousay the school bus hostage you thinkthey would start wearing that was thiskind of a passive hostage the sameprocess for their concern but acompletely different inputs as far asthe network is concerned because theyare evil to the 256 by 256 image thereare 65,000 inputs and you are doingcomplex combinations of these inputsinto other features and making decisionsto training data to reduce that anythingever and if there is a little noise inthe training data then you can show thatthere will never be any death of apersonexamples and I presume example in thisparticular case is an example that notonly drives the learner to make thewrong classification it was clear thatit's not in that distribution this kindof carefully constructed school buseswere not rich in the distribution that Igave youbut that's like assuming that I'm goingto build death star and only naturalevents will ever hit this dead star nota cell phone but handsome Ford knowsexactly what the weak point is and it'sone point zero certainly avoid that ifyou put a machine learning systemoutside and people want to bring it downthey will generate adversary examplesand present it to them and the fact thatmachine learning example algorithms cando this kind of adversary examples notthis kind that we kind of know thatanybody can do this kind where nobody inthe group would even think that themachine would have gotten mistaken bythat but the Machine actually gives ifI'm a house it doesn't make sense thiswas what I think it's confidence thatthis is a school bus was always like inmind like 87% that this is an ostrich islike more like 97% it's more like anostrich very excess food was confusingyou it should not because you said useof this crazy task of taking 65,000dimensional input tuning fifteen millionparameters and whatever depending on howbig your network is to reduce thetraining error at that point our socksare crazy things can happen so one we'rekind of overfitting that can behappening is really kind of it's allactual fitting for its these adversaryexamples so the machines are looking atthe world but not the way you arelooking at them and so in fact where weuse itcoming onto the scene so you think thateven from higher dimensional space yesthere is some nice clean fabrics museumsdecision this is a key one this is abouthow this is my mother etc but this is noreason for you to believe that is thedata it's only something like thisequally possible that it's alreadysomething like this that's one slivercuts parts to chips out of us literallyis our dimensional space corresponds topandas 99.9% of the space containingpoints that don't follow any of theseleaders then it's just basically seeingwhat is the NeoStrataplus and now you start worrying about ohmy god I might dependent downyes laughs I mean musk is going to bethere so in the beginning when this cameup people used to together is justbasically people are trying to find somefaults that they're not real force thisis this go away is a beast a smallmistake okay we'll just a pocket thecourt will approve it it is nobody inthe border this is par for the coursewhat you have to do right now I'm sorryfact no this is Japanese I'm saying yeahso in fact this idea is actual networkswhich is some other thing that we'd evermight have might be slightly more robustnobody really knows they could beadvanced and ever said examples forcapsule refuse to but really what ishappening is this crazinesshalf-height a marshmallow inputs so ingeneral that particular guy Athena butin a says adversarial examples forinterconnected classifiers aresyntactically dance in Subang labels arenon deterministic which means if thereis noise in the training data and thevoice is not deterministic then in orderto fit to the training data exactly tohave zero ever which anybody with foodthey knew they would wind up openingthemselves to a large numbers basicallyagainst accept adversarial examples inall these regions approximately this iswhere we are with respect to networks sowhat we do when we come back next classis actually do this one variant ofneural networks are Terminixconvolutional neural networks read upabout them in the chapter and[Music]
