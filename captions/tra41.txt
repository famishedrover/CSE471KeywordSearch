think about if everybody every point isan access unto itselfconcert the case in the previous takeevery point is a functional point if Iput every point itself at that point youknow for sure that it can be separatedso there is there an asymptoticguarantees that everything can beseparated if only you grow up thedimensionality the question is sometimesyou might be able to grow up thedimensionality to a much lower level andstill be able to separate them andsecond buffer it's actually silly tofirst blow up the dimensionality thenseparate and then come back yourselfbecause that's what they essentially doout of the box instead there aretechniques such as third LS Williamswhich do this working in one countrywhich is why they're become popular okayso in ourselves what they will do isthey will come up with specific kinds ofthese things for kernel functions whichif you have X 1 X 2 a polynomial kernelfunction half I will consider how I'mdiamond tional polynomially not question5 dimensional Pournami about the termsso in the high dimensional polynomialwhat are the terms that will be there ifyou have X 1 and X 2 X 1 plus X to thepower 5 a 1 dimensional X 1 plus X 2power five will have X 1 / 5 X to power5 you have X 1 to power 4 times X 2 willax 1 for 3 times X to power to attractright but each of these terms do youhave a dimension and then for everythingwhose XY values you know you will beable to compute these neuters and itturns out under check different patternsit's so that you can come back okay soin fact as I pointed out when you dothat kind of a thing for example this isX 1 and X 2 and a circular data insidethe third pillar is positive or negativeideas outside of that bill is positiveclearly there is no money to separatethis but if on the other hand youconsider a two dimensional space at somestrain root 2 X 1 X 2 X 2 square rightthat's a common your thermaltransformation it's a subspace actuallyright and in that space if you actuallycompute each of these points coordinatesin this three dimensional space then youwill be able to see that there is aplate and what kind of functions do isthere in want some soup take you fromhere to here find the equation of aplane come back and tell you what theequation of the plane is in this videoand it will be okay so that is SVM'sright so that's one idea you guysprobably didn't hear about it becausethere's not too much hype about it rightnow this is 90 side here nobody is 90 sooption so basically what was happeningwas it's after 80 is people actuallyhave figured out that propagation andpeople who are trying to use my delayand neural networks and they were stillnot working there was this old man carbody made that week he's old now but Ithinkand then we were landing around inMoscow in 1960s only everything happenedaround the time I was bornhe basically our recent admonition inother ships is getting even havecomputers so they just have things andmaybe something and then they just writestuff on this table and you know mapdoesn't need much more than thatRobert Einstein's wife told somebody myhusband doesn't need any you knowhardware it just makes it bettermath is abstract right so what do youfound was the form of the idea of SVMcenter of machines in 1960s who everexpects to look in Russian was goodstuff so we ignore it we continue doingour own random stuff and in fact he wastrying to then use it as he else wasdoing some cancer magnet supplier and inthe 1990s he was brought in one of thegreatest research facilities in the USbefore it got no pretty much any damnthing that we use today can we traceback to research done in tethers andpeople used to him base redevelops wasthis monopoly of that telephone companyand they are enough money that they canalso support research nowadays nobodysuppose research research is I kind ofthink that you would you have lots ofextra money there okay so they used todo stuff without knowing whether or notI'd ever be useful their laps basicallyinvented transistors talipesyou know my mind is is actually a verysmall place but here were able to getnot without details at that timeactually it was a great departmentprinciples of my department and the labspeople who would now have basically 500different races including gambling goodwas did and you know and then braggedabout it so he gave us conferences thatwe write some um sweeper so he's not apaper through 1991 units and who rejectsit was a time when they wanna mebecause maybe seven papers will besubmitted they still say not what imageokay so it was rejected then he waslooking that people were trying to dothis digit classification that was thething that countenance became popularokay he was doing Emily's busyclassification and people are doingthese are doing it with these familiesreassurance Moses why I bet I can dothis much better and were you not gotthis was what in their walk with him andthey both and she and he essentially gotstate-of-the-art performance analystmuch less training much less data neededin fact the thing is that essentiallyshe is tend to be then they won fourproblems of which both multi-layeracross internal machines were parodiesof pee better in terms of samplecomplexity in terms of learning theinsecurities of glory typically is notthe computer time it is the number ofexamples youdo you understand what I'm saying theslow learners need lot more example thefast learners need fewer examples it'snot a computer file which the number ofsamples that's why we think in terms oftime complexity but Staphylococcus andpaternal support vector machines samplecomplexity is typically much lower thanthat for multi-layer networks and sothey wrote the very - so if you're doingthis we would basically okaybut now basically nobody is in hired bya platoon to be hanging around infacebook is that trophy mathematician ifyou know what I mean so he just hangsaround there in fact a very interestingbut that's a big story other thing whichalways possible this was done before orafter Allah in having multi-layernetworks in fact in fact and in factthis is what we showed you this exampleif you guys look at it you understoodthat can we have a book what isinterestingthis then is heretherefore cutting machines to that youknow that for a single layer network noteven a boolean functions can be doneright but the question is you put morelayers at least with why actually wecould learn X on the question is howmany do you put to get more and morefunctions or communities will put onemore daysee what happens until the bossy asecondmathematicians have no buses they don'tget much period so they write actuallytheorems report the hill in the roadessentially in the beauty report on thatwas the one thing that you want toremember is that given any continuousfunction any continuous functionuttering boots there exist some neuralnetwork with one hidden layer whichapproximates it which approximates thatfunction any level of accuracythis is this you should be I'm ponderingfive back to any give themI just need one layer it's truemathematically you don't need more thanone layer if you are looking only at[Music]this I never said how many units ofkernel machines they essentially cantake a two-dimensional data row it up toinfinity mushrooms and then look for aline separating them so in the worstcase that would not put as a beautifulmight have owes to infinite number ofhidden their units and you cannot justsay I searched for moneyokaymulti-layer networks use two layers theinteresting question is to get startedand also to don't know how to read apitch the first one is still true it canstill get started off early and thesecond one is false it turns out thatthe same chain rule that you used tocompute the gradient at the first layerwill also work for the second layer inparticular so this is that in innovationI believe that talked to you about itnext well I will record somethingwalking you through this duration nextclass is just chain rule believe me butthe two parts I want you to remember isfor the first place the waves here therewill be updated usingdispiriting and notice this meaning isthat this is a chi - I mean sure youhave it looks exactly the same form andfrom the second layer - basicallyokay and in particular if you do PRunderstanding this is you know whateveris on the highest layer because you knowwhat the actual values are suppose youdon't know what the L is heremost people who started thinking mostpsychologists for the ones we should belearning psychologists are fashionablein math and everything remover theEmily's here we don't know Martin L ishere who could we figure out to be mysee this is what I'm sayingturns on access to big question to askyou but if you're a psychologist and youstill owe us a road map tell me someintuition here is the intuition that's avery lasting identity if you have everhere you need to give the video each ofthese visions okay imagine I have anhello here I hunted this guy has madezero this guy has 800 this guy has beenzero eight zero who should be blamed forthe evident Alaska we will start to ITbusinesses because we have zero rates wecould have caused any error this time isthat I read much about them let's giveall the error to him when Davidso in essence in 100 zero zero if youwind up having this is 75 this is 3047 this is 87 I can then essentiallydivide the other two each of these unitsin proportion to the weight with whichthis unit is connected to every if yousay that psychologist in fact many manybooks will explain back propagation thisway as if there is some chopped up a youknow miss lavinia you have to decide whoto blame for how much and let's just dothis each you give me this way it turnsout that this intuitive definition isalso what the math test it stop herecome back next class[Music]
