is this just a mathematical trick tomake an infinite series sum to a finitenumber actually yescan use them back paddle and somehowrationalize is a joke take this job tellme what's funny about itso this data so they're going throughsome and they finally seemed like a a mysignal what about them right and one guystarts desperately trying to drink andthis guy in the back saying it's notjust following your hearts and everyonelet's let this one what it will lead usall and see if it gets any order is thisfunnyI happen to know how about this one sothey normally say whatever is all aboutme 15 million dollars 1.7 billiondollars in whatever like seven pointseven billion dollars and in theswampland after you give me you take anice big enough back and try to walk andsecond point seven billion the povertyis either will give you three millionper year for infinite number of yearsI will give you actually forty milliondollars lump sum instead of setting sothat 1.3 million is with the expectationthat will only take early payment andthen we could win the lottery somepeople actually take the lump sumpayment some takeokay so my question is not existso what is happening in both these casesso here you're assuming the worlddoesn't exist so what I get today iswhat I getthis is kind of what happens when lightsgo up in New York City people thinkthere may not be any tomorrow what I getis what I getlet's just break into all the shops andget the stuff and we have and I likecoming out and then you see themactuallyokay so this time I'm actually thinkingthat what is going down I'm kind of aschmuck in here would actually be nicerationality is modulated on how muchfuture reward is what with respect sosimple question I have is if I tell youI will give you $10 now thousand dollarsten thousand years from now which 1000years 1000 years mister 1,000 years 500years 500 years twenty years thirtyyears two years some two years tendollars now $1,000 us some vamosright so the point I'm trying to make isit is a individual preference inparticular that we value that we'resaying can we see now that histonefactor can be interpreted as how muchfuture reward is worth to you in currenthours so if you folks are number ofyears then XA beta is X 8.5 then $10five years from now is 0.5 power fivetimes ten dollars now this you're insaneso the beta is between 0 and 1 if it iscloser to 1 that means you reallybelieve that the world will exist forquite a long time if it is only to 0 youthink it's our lap oh and you know whathe's assigning within this questionafter Devon is in the coal mine rightthey tend again ways into the pose mineto see whether or not it's safe it's atrack so you know what is the latestsign in that the one according to somepeople is still be around graduatestudents because if you think the one isgoing to end after primary school inwhatever job you think it may not andright away maybe years later in highschool you stop and take over graduatestudents are the most optimistic aboutthe world actually[Music][Music]so this is what it has be tend todiscount future with respectRedd Palin who wears the red button
