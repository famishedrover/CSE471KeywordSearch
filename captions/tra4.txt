[Music][Music]so yeah Karima okay so Daniel Kahnemanand that means a very good friend andwas first ski have done some of thegreatest work in behavioral economicsthe particular showing the people areirrational that we are predictablyirrational Tom house of proceedings wedo and so it's kind of strange that wetry to actually develop young age estabaperfectly national where in fact we arecompletely rational ourselves and getout several things that we do in theparticular for example you may havenoticed put this thing up that we havesome how much influenced by statisticbecause it's not and so the stuff thatyou skip to look at the pictures is youshould rule so suppose you are having avery fast journey of some time enginewhat is basically trying to show is thatpeople remember cups actually experiencemarker them fire sergeant but what justhappens towards the end particular keepthis interesting experiment some peoplehaving this are going towards the endthey increase the pain and others theyjust afford it now they have to submitoxygen and the people who have aslightly higher paid towards the endtalking to the really doctor and youshould never have as early and peoplewho have the tampering effect dataasthma okay so that's called the peakand groom and since you are alsoinvasion of I'm finding about you I'mgiving you a Sperry barsyou know so I understand okay[Music][Music]let's convert the gym okay[Music]so you have and just to remind you thisis essentially about the course cut ithas nothing to do with the coursedelivery and the inspector please do notuse to either put are bad things aboutme don't feel compared to any of thatyou actually have a separate Avenue butAnonymous is saying as part of thecollective evaluations college teachingevaluations all the things that youwanted okay I'm told there are about 20people who already responded I can't seethe responses like now they don't bettersomehow see I'm two techniques are givenI don't know why so given that sopleased to take part a lot to keeparound anonymous feedback about the pastbut this is matted with this is a treata person after final exam okay so anyquestions before we go away okay so thelast class we were talking aboutbackground Abram two things first of allpop teddy is going to be a mini projectthis one has no there is no coding onwhat you try to exercise what youlearned about the various networkscheering okay I'm trying to make surethat are compatible so that's why itmight take some time at most likely todo it is the project but an ending withthe exact details some how to submit acopy but in fact we will try to make[Music]so that's going to happen that's goingto beat you the last bus okay so anyquestions okay so we were talking aboutfaculty perhaps is I believe Fast Passwith an ex-player session I believe andthat's very important to understand Ihope you know and you understand thatessentially the conditional probabilitytables can be thought of as factors whenmultiplied will give you the jointdistribution where the multiplication isnot a matrix multiplication what it isthis funny joy in multiplication so yousort of join their two relations andmultiply the numbers that's what we havegot okay and so anytime I talk about ingeneral it's not surprising because inthe very best case probabilitiesmultiply right that's what you have seenwhenever if you are you know if I askyou what's the probability of a and Band C being true together you don't haveto answer that but if I say there areindependent then you say wow you knowit's probably okay so even the best isessentially probably MultiPlan okayand what we are essentially trying to dois it's not necessary that everything iscompletely independent of each other butinstead they have some dependencies buteach the dependencies are fewer thanthat worst case scenario and so in whichis what you're multiplying is thisconditional probability tables okay sothis will work as I said last time alsofor completely dependence in it wherethere won't be any in this until we seethere is about okay so that's aboutfaculty bruh and you have to keep thatin mind and you in fact think ofgraphical models SNas they we are providing that pathologyafter model which is the connectionsbetween the variables that will tell youhow they factorize and then the actualnumbers are the conditional already inthe tables you see what I'm sayingso it's like this the most importantpart reallyafter the Bayes network is its topologyand then of course the numbers okay onceyou give the topology you already knowwhat condition property tables we haveto provide and then you multiply thosetables you get the food joint okay sothat's the thing that you don'tunderstand and really there is nothingmore - based networks essentially arepractical models they are factorizing ahuge Joint Distribution okay now since Ikept saying this so one of the thingsthat they're actually trying to do hereis in essence there is a conditionalindependencies that are being here so ifthe very best case a and B are Cvariables yes they'll have to be debatedin which case there won't be any HSallowed in the network in the very worstcase we complete a cyclic graph inbetween there will be some number ofedges but one somehow our edges aremissing so in a sense what we are tryingto do in providing this topology is tosay it's not all of nothing it's noteither fully independent everything isindependent of everything was everythingis different on everything depending onthe domain some things are completedwith some things okay and you starttrying to provide what are actually theminimal ways of how those things areconnected and once you provide that tosome extent the edges in the BayesNetwork provide you conditionalindependence assertions and givenconditional independence assistanceworld you can divide other conditionalassertions and why are the conditionaldependence assertions useful they arereally only useful in devising inferencealgorithms for Bayes networks you seewhat I'm saying why is the independencethe best here everything is divided upeverything elsewhat has that saved you essentially it'sa view you can compute any problem withany fast by using the ok so conditionalindependence assumptions are used in theout of them's in in the first of thelimbs in trying to do the Bayes Networkis perhaps faster okay keep that in mindso the question of course then is can wesay with more about conditionaldependencies so in general you would tryto write conditions this way why given Cin general x y&z they cannot be cannotbe sets of random variables they don'thave to be nuture independent animation[Music]individual random variables not singlerandom variables they can be set uprandomly so the set X of randomvariables is conditionally independentof the set of random variables given thestatus of the set C coverage statusmeans what are the values in general youknow that's the kind of you know giventhis evidencethose two are you okay now once I knowthis if for example X is independent ofa given C it can be used in manydifferent bits for example is allpossible ways of using that one singleexpression if X is different of vitaminC then if I ever ask you what's p x andy given city you get to write it as P XP and C times P Y given this what I'msaying x and y so the difference is if Cis not the end if I just find this X isindependent of what that means is justin depending upon you don't need to tellany other variables but if X isdifferent of my given C which is themore general condition then only whenyou do the value of C is X independentokay and in general if this is true thenyou can use this X and C is activitytaxpayers similarly we have X given byMC okay two pieces of evidence y and zis really nothing but he even we have Xgiven C because why does not add anymore once I go see okay and finallysimply py5 given X C is again via fiveyears all of these are is of this singleassertion this conditional independenceassertion and you want to think of Bayesnets essentially as encoding theseconditional independence assumptionsokay we already notice that that is infact independent of you know we even seetheir probability of ABC joint propertyABC and it has probably using chain ruleta given be seenwe see which every pass in your busytime time see this part these two piecesbasically just watch Andrew right thesetwo pieces watch a move and at thispoint I realize a human be seems nothingbut a Q&C because there is integrated ofthe music and similarly B given C willbe B given C and there is so now you areable to write this as a multiplicationof these distributions normally for theChinese situation with three booleanvariables are you need eight minus onenumbers the specified but here I'mgetting by with just five numbers rightbecause one number here two numbers hereI am two numbers here is what I'm sayingso everything's our love is connectedthat it's our connected ultimately dueto the conditional independenceassertions so in probability that youknow that maybe semantics come from thiscondition assessor okay how do you knowit's a conditionally independent this isyou happen to know your domain right soyou my example might know that your haircolor is independent of you are createdin the classmaybe not believe so that's your validassumption and so you basically believethat they're given okayand similarly in general basically yourdomain knowledge that is giving you thisespecially if you are trying to figurethis out empirically if you want tofigure out that condition assertionsconditional dependencies for empiricallythen you actually have to for examplecompute the two properties from yourproperty a given BC and assess them agiven me so he given exceeding even seeand say that depth a so I'm if you haveasked you to assess these in the whitein the real world okayprobability of a given B and C which tosee is true and then you also accessprobability of a images seized and thenthose two numbers are equal that meansit must have been conditionallydependentokay but sometimes you have to draw orthe domain and so you notice withouthaving to go through all thesemachinations or get somethingso in general conditional dependenceofficials tell you something about thetiming so that domain knowledge okaynow the question of course then is whydon't we just write down how thecondition remains assertions that holdin a domain that's what the Bayesnetwork is except it turns out that anumber of conditional independenceassertions in a domain can beexponentially large what you need towant to do is take the small subset fromwhich everything else follows and writejust a small subset okay so that'sbasically what Bayes networks try to -there can be excruciating miniconditional independence exceptions thatwhat is a domain and and so thebrilliant idea is maybe we should justimplicitly specified by a conditionaldimensions by writing only the localdependencies between variablesaccording some topological okay and theneverything else and then if providedother than them that tells yougiven the Bayes network in ourconfiguration - after you saw Mossad isslightly already said I pointed outGospels that the main independenceassertion that is working in a Bayesnetwork is ignored is conditionallyindependent of actually I should havesaid all on descendants given experienceI said ancestors even experience butactually is dependent of allnon-descendantsgiven experience non-descendants Ebru ofcourse ancestors but also includessiblings this what I'm sayingso that is the minimum of a snackor even a basic or configuration andeven back then I can answer many manyqueries I'll show you you know whetheror not I said a is the different upsetwe given sexy ok so that's basicallywhat we are trying to do is network in away of compactly representing the localconditioning diffidence assertions andthen providing an idea Rd separationwhich tells you what are the otherassertions that ok and let me give youmore examples of this so the simplest asI said actually is this the network inan English Network the node X isconditionally independent of all theseancestors and there's alwaysnon-descendantswhich includes ancestors as well assiblings immediate leaders that's themain local conditional independenceassertion in a Bayes Network and we usethis in computing the 20 solutionremember ok now the thing is this onestill leaves this guy characted to itschildren and children's children and sooninstead of saying humidified myimmediate parents i might still bedependent I might still be have relatedwith either children our children'schildren I'm no longer connected withthe ancestors and the siblings and thesiblings general matter but I'm stillcovered in our descendantsokay to exploit that actually so this issimple this is the main conditionaldependence assertion there is a at theapprentice on you see the watch justifythe channelization of this call themotto blanket and in case you forget inall days - with his security blanketso Markov blanket is a blanket at a nodecan throw around itself to become weeklysecure from the experience of anybodyelse okay and of course the motto packetcontains the immediate period but inaddition it contains its other at meanspoint of time tenure secure and it'sactually important to understand thesenetworks and how compact it is giventhat the moon is independent ofeverybody else so if I am trying torandomly given a basic what one of themost useful things we will do andactually I talked about it later is tobe able to sample the value of a veryrandomly sample the value of it givensome idiots the interesting thing issampling the value of this variable isan arbitrary evidence on the networkthat includes the Markov blanket is thesame as sampling that network given justa motto blanket do you see what I'msayingso basically it's like we a given B andG is the same as PA given B that meansgiving C is not happy similarlysampling in North value using a wholeset of variables that is the superset ofthe macro blanket all the pattern isestimate okay okay so this is actuallyvery useful in sampling these notesthere is a great idea at MC MC cargowhich essentially sample each boardusing it okay there are two ways ofdoing acting difference on gradesnetworks one is the exact algorithmsthat involved using the JointDistribution table more efficiently theother is approximate algorithms whereyou sample networks and then so if forexample there are a whole bunch ofsamples then you can then take yourratio okaythose are the two ideas and forlarge-scale network sampling approachesof the only things that work well andsummarizing there are essentially twomain local dependency assertions thatjust from our free given a maze networkokay what is this which is a node isindependent of its non-descendants givenits immediate variance this is a thingthat you know this is the minimum youneed to and then the other is actuallyequal to another one basically is a nodeis independent of everybody elsegiven its mark on there and welcome backit is more general because here the modeis not independent of its descendantseven if you give the immediate valueswhereas this you understand so you don'tneed to get the cruncher you can putthem outside in the backyardthey won't affect you as long as youhave your children in the main okayso that's basically the hot all rightokay so these two two things that oneremember the next thing of course is howto generalize this such that such thatgiven these local to assumptions if Ihave any opportunity query given set aand set B and the neverland set C andset C of random variables can I say X isindependent of Y you will see her back Iwant an actual you clearly can answersome of them so for example in thisparticular case is John comingindependently depends of are they givena la yes ticket such as comes from thedirect local independence okay how aboutis John coming independent of manycommon given a la yesokay because very Colleen is bad is anundescended that also comes directly butin general I should be able to answerany arbitrary clearly of this particularokay and to do that I use this ideatardy separation which is a slightly youknow my pending idea but you need toknow followers okay so here is the basicidea any separation thing comes huge bigNetwork right network is networkavailable guards right here are the Xnodes here are my notes here every dayis not sleep here of the nodes that areactually in evidence this stuff is notin evidenceokay that means you know you know thisvalues of these variablesthe question then is given this isaccidental firing given one arbitrarysimple thing is actually to understandthat you know there are paths herebetween the variables are variablesthere are arrow paths actually upof course of doing these analysisactually issue hallows don't haveelectionsany path is interesting so any path thatwas from X to Y to see okay what we wantto say essentially is if all thoseperhaps are blocked we define whatblocking means then X is independent sosomehow we are trying to capture thisnotion of probabilistic influence movingon these average what I'm sayingso if every path from X to Y is blocked[Music][Music]the arrows are going out from Z ahthe arrows are coming in to see agreedthis one we'll call it a castle pathagain the word Castle is used not in thetrue causation sense it's as if webasically think of our direction asapproximately covered it's not supposedto because without this house apart thisis called common cause this is a causalchain path this is the common cause butZ is actually causing for this guyokay and the third one is commonetiquette the thing that should beslightly tricky about dependencecomputation based networks is what youwould like to say the simple thing thatyou are understood in look these twopaths are not here this appears to yournotions of exits in graphs like in agraph you can have a cut set if youremove those vertices to other sets ofvertices are actually disconnected youunderstand what I am saying this is whatyou would really want it to be okay itis actually true in a differentgraphical model Markov random fields theMarkov random fields you have nodes likethis with no directions and basicallyyou will see this set is independent ofthe said given evidence which cuts themwhich cuts the graph is your tax rate mypoint is you have really understoodyourselves pretty obvious stuff if itwas a car sent it's almost a cat saidwhat that explaining in a head part
