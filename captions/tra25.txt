essentially says that the world that thecommitment here is not about agreeablein particularly of truth that means aparticular statement when I say 4.7probability that means in four wordsit's likely to be true in other threewords is likely to be falsefuzzy logic says in a given worldthis statement is point seven true in asingle given world the statement ispoint seven which is a different kind ofcommitment these the probe listing logicand fuzzy logic are very different pieceactually okay we will really not talkabout fuzzy logic there are all sorts ofinteresting problems that come up if youactually try to do fuzzy logic becausebecause it tries to use degree of truthand uses more or less the rules ofpropositional logic and that leads toall sorts of inconsistencies but peoplewho use it and get some results buttheoretically it's not a sound basisokay this is one of us what yourtextbook would also say so that's yourparty logic and then these are all theholy for the Mattocks and of which Iwould definitely do this I'll definitelydo this and then do that very very muchokay now before I go forward I have tosay remember I said how logics aredefined in terms of words and in factmaybe the two are false in a voice thinkin terms of propositional logic think interms of John and many came to the bodykind of so the question then is thenotion often if you say a word with afact F each is called a model of thatmeans the world where that fact is trueso if you make a fact which has nomodels whatsoever that means not it thendoesn't exist a single word where thiswill be can you guys at this level alphathe symptoms in the John maybe going toparty format which has no morals do youthink first of all if I say John andMary went to give the party you canimagine there being a word that bothJohn and Mary kept the body so it's actsfunJohn I really came to the party you canimagine a world with either one or twoeither one of the other or both havedone yes when John came to party andJohn didn't come to the party of you goJohn came to the party I'm John didn'tcome to the partythese are what I'm saying so these areGod I will satisfy full sentences theyhave no models you think what is thepoint of thinking about these sentenceswhy think of sentences for which thereis no real world there is no formalworld where that sentence can evaluateto true just keep hold on to the startwill find out that unsatisfiability is abedrock of logics in fact you can putthe question of doesn't that follow fromwhat I know to showing that theknowledge and negation of this fact isunsatisfied you understand I'm sayingthink about this John and Mary came tothe party is a sentence and you allagreed that that implies that Mary cameto the party that means Mary came to theparty is intended by the knowledge Johnand Mary came to the wirehow do you know here is a big take whatyou know which is John and Mary came tothe party add to that the negation ofwhat you want to do you want to provethat Mary did come to the party so youadd mary did come to the party so now Ihave this complete sentence saying Johnand Mary came to the party and mary didcome to the choir that's just a complexwas not the thing that he was talkingabout because it has as part of itMiriam the partyit successfully so in fact you provethings by showing that the thing thatyou want to prove if it's not true withrespect to what you know then I meanusually if you take what you're tryingto prove and negate it and add it towhat you know there can't be any voidswhere our dispute by the way there is amathematical proof technique whichactually uses it what is itexactly proof by contradiction you wantto prove something you take the negationof what you are trying to prove that'snot possible there is no water here thisis possible when did we use this proofin this class how proofs our logic yousee what I'm saying okay so all of thisbasically is getting you to the pointthat if I have a knowledge base thenthere are some words in which thatknowledge base that's it let's just sayhere is the set of words where theknowledge base is true now I want tocheck if alpha follows from theknowledge base that means is it and takeand I know KB and I write alpha knowingwith maybe uncounted to the partyand I like maybe came to the party rightso that question then is well everythingin fact this is this particular set ofwords set of models of kini is itsmeaning when you think of what is thesemantics in logic the meaning of asentence is the set of words where thatsit in seiza unity which when people aresaying I love mylike has no meaning I'm not quite surewhat they are yet but here I know thatin logical sentences you say that asentences meaning is just the set ofwords when it is truth so John Cameronand John not coming at the same time tothe party that set is empty set so ithas no meaningokay so here is the meaning of Cayleyalso itself is anniversay but alphabasically if I try to write out fires asentence then it has probably a set ofwords very digital so my question thenis so I can consider the followingthings suppose this is the set of wordsfor ice cream can I say that alpha canbe written to be true because knowledgebase is true then I said knowledge baseis true that means I'm in one of theworld scene dancingin fact if I have let's say bqr as thepropositions then I say there are 2power 3 on eight words if I say P istrue how many words are I possibly needonly for this actually tells youknowledge is equal to Rho constrainedno need something more constrains howyour world is the more you know thefewer configurations the world canactually have if I do tell you anythingother than there are PQR your world yourmana reports I said well B is true forwords we are curious to do words P and Qis true on honey spots in one word he istrue and B is false you are in no voidthese are insane so in fact you cancount the number of Polar'sgiven a knowledge base of account thenumber of words that are consistentlyand remember some time back and we aredoing that the estar said I said setsuperset relations we take them forgranted but mostly everything at thetruth from set so for set relations itis another one okay so you said this soby the way but entailment can use thisfunny notation if I am like this KP doesnot entail how about this okaythese are all the words that cable istrue these are all the words without myit's truein this case is our finding it's ourpatented ok how many of you think out bythat date in that case it shows how hardon the back of your head and say neveragain say that ok it's very importantunderstand by it's actually terms of a508 but why because damn kb is trueimagine if it is true because you'reactually in this world it's awkward tosay so to be able to say that alpha isEnfield by Kb the set of models of howfar should be a superset of the set ofmodels of the knowledge base we justconvertedentailment into second it's not wedidn't do something new today that's howbasically mathematics the semantics ofmathematics okay but many people fallfor this Rockford is in general all thisis doing is actually stating it this isthe model for KB and this is the modelsof alpha in this case you can say KBentail something like this it'sextremely simple okay this is whatyou're trying to do in some sense andthat is really comfy back the modelbasically including all the models whereyour knowledge base is true and checkingbetween each of those were selfishdo you see what I'm saying this is truefor perpetuitythis is to Connecticut logic this is toofast or too much why don't we do it thatway why waste time talking into somebecause if there are there are there areno justice you know I use this merely todo divisions then waves this is thedefinition this is the semantics ofderivatives but you basically do this ifyou ever two things directly from thisapparently by looking at the modelsyou'd say model theoretic computationcontainment and then we talk about acheaper way called true theoreticcomputation attentively it's the kind ofthing that you know that you say if aand B are true then you get to read itif it implies P is true and a happenedthen you're going to write B if impliesP is true and you know think it nothappen you get the right it did nothappen so this is what I said let's seeit implies B is true it did not happenyou get to write evening not happen howmany people think this is actually madeup this is Python this is some room thisis so and B is not true if ever true wewill automatically become true this isyou can't stop this you're dancing thisis not some sort of a process as soon asit is true in every world the range tobe with you - that's what is implies Bmeans ok so this is actually it has aname it's called models all endssimilarly the other ones that we rotatea implies B is true is true then P istrue this is called models then in thisother rule this rule is truemark is true I'm sorry anyplace B istrue is true so Hades this is Pythonprovince it's not a logical rule aimplies B is true and if just because bis true thousand bill is true Sam Dekkeralso a B D implies B and D is truethat's why I became this your damnsinging okay anyway but these types ofrules is what will pop up as logicbeforethat's called proof here at a conferenceand all inferences are fine to computeand tailmon compute this just as trueand all the other rules of derivationderivatives that you use ultimately howdo you prove chain rule to be correctyou use this how do you prove any ofthese rules okay good questions okay sothere is a model-basedand then application of inference rulesthose are the two things that happenedand I've sort of been using and then youhave an inference you can talk aboutsince remember ultimately what you'retrying to compute is this this is therelation you're trying to compute themodel theoretic and then you may have abunch of rules like a might be is trueis foolish the question then is thisroom actually every time this guycaptions do you understand what I'msaying so I can ask the followingquestion if this rule says a particularstack is empty is it really a treethat's one part of the question thequestion is if this semantics says aparticular fact in a trade with thiswe'll be able to say that those are twodifferent aspects and one is calledsoundness the other is calledcompletenessyou say a room this song is then everyou apply the rule you write a fact tobe true you can be sure that that factis actually true according to the modelit and a rule is completely any time infact can be derived anytime in fact theywill prove to be true from the modeltheory this rule also will let you writeokay while there is a word that is usedwhen you write this is you would say aimplies B and D allows you to devaluenotice that the relation is differentfrom entails relation and device isbeing used to compute that TechNetrelation okay and the question of courseis is the derived equation really equalto that in relation and it could besound if everything that is different isactually contained it is complete ifeverything that can be that is actuallyobtained is derived now my question isis my response sound when you say it's areasonable room for watching you say -good room that means it's a sound ruleif you use that rule to write a factit's actually the question is easy tocomplete it turns out correspondence byitself is not happy if you just usemodus ponens you write a bunch of factsat a red tape but there are bunch ofother facts of a change that you won'tbe able to fight you see what I'm sayingso it turns out the same for MorrisCollege it is essentially someone butnot on and there is actually want to infact until you came to this class youhave not heard of a propositional ruleofsilence that is both sound and completeokay give me a booth that is justcomplete it may not be song we may putthat company may not do so notice that Iseparated these things out can you giveme a rule that's just complete butthey're not be sound but it's somethingfor sure ask me a question is a factokay I say yes ask me another questionabsolutely yesthis is about yes ma'am cool everythingwhatever you ask you say yes isn't it doyou realize that it's complete would itbig sound no they need to pay foreverything so it is actually possible tocome up with vacuously complete rulesit's actually possible to come up withvacuously complete rules okaybut getting a rule that is both soundand complete is pretty hard in fact mostof you probably haven't heard of themeven though this is well known one howmany have you done logic courses okay soyou know what I'm talking aboutwhat's the rules of propositionalinference rule that is both sound andcompany and we just keep using that ruleyou will get everything that that dayand nothing more resolution you canstick this in your logic classes andthat's what we're doing it okay and sowe keep some suspense and figure I'lltell you what resolution rule is laterbut resolution rule of inferencebasically is a generalization of allthese rules and if you just keep usingthat rule all the time then it works onand oh by the way this is the separationof soundness and completeness isconnected to a bunch of other things ifyou ever go to the court of law theymake you take a page right then theytake effect before starting being awitness what are the whatyes tell the whole truth and nothing butthe truthokay say it again whole truth andnothing but the truthwhy do watch is it just because of OldEnglish nonsense he's your namesake oldtrue is soundness nothing but the truthis completeness I'm sorrytruth is completeness and nothing butthe truth is soundness okay there'sanother set of words that you know whensome of you know which is precision andrecall same idea precision essentiallyis connected to soundness Rica isconnected to completeness complete thatsound means rest upon Raghava okay sonow we'll just walk through this veryquickly because I'm assuming that youknow logic so this is some of the syntaxof product s one implies as two is canbe this way R can be written this wayhow many of you have not seen logicalrotation like ever before those of youwho better make sure that in fact Iasked you to read the readings thatwould have also made sure that youunderstood many of you have seen itmultiple times in your life okay sothat's our propulsion logic this issyntax these are the kinds of thingsthat you can write so can you give me asentence that's not even syntacticallycorrect yeah what one equals no in factyou transfer this really cause yetequality is typically added on top ofthis the simplest propulsion magic onlyhas this one toward conjunction this oneis called disjunction this one is callednegation and this is for implicationand in fact it turns out here you placeme is identically equal to mark a partythis is actually very important forpeople to understand many people willget any play speed and think it is acausation it is causing me no it's justa fact about the words with NK I foundsort of thing in anyone that is true wecan just close your license in thesestudents in any word will mean is nottrue you can both your I can say isdefinitely our key in any world where Bis true you can't say anything about itthis what I'm saying okay so my myoriginal question was and it give mesomething that syntactically incorrectlyso you see that the correctness meanscompiler should say are your drugs iswhat I have to do what you like this Ilike thisthis is what I'm sayingthese allow basically in the tacticallyin correct sentences so those are theones where basically you have a passwordthe password can't even pass percentageso it's attractive so I'd avoid trickydown complex sentences we take thissyntax right wewe place our j RM and we had him mark Pimplies this whole thing impliesI got a huge one sentence this sentencealso given a single word will either betrue or false is your website just likethis is basically seatbacksnow the semantics is basically definedsemantics this way in any world s istrue not as expose in any world both s1is true or s2 is true s1 and s2 is trueand in the world either as fullness toall s2 is true as wellRS to Israel and so on the obviousthings that you have a semantics forthese operations rules I should be ableto compute for any world where I knowJW okay this sentence is made up of onlythose guys right that actually how manyare there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 so they reallyabout need to power in words in whichthe sentence the minimum who politic wasin which the sentence can be valuedright and any one of those words so forexample that say this is true this isfalse this is true this is true this isfalse this is true this is false falseyou should be able to work these guys inand say this entire sentencing is thetruth of fastthis is knowing with me right that'sbasically what you mean by the meaningof the same in a given word for cabbageand so I'm going to be good this isbasically right away the fact that thetrueafter large sentence is computed interms of the truth topics constituentsit makes this troop functional andpropositional logic our deterministiclogics have this beautiful propertythat's why they're easy logicsprobabilistic logic doesn't have thisproblem that's right times people up thewall you know how many times we've mademost of the mistakes we do in reasoningin all their life connectedprobabilistic logic because we tend tothink to the extent possible in logicand our intuitions suck as far asprobability science if you say paradoxtypically it'll be a promise to correcterrors because we just don't know how toreason with their carrier there aremachines that can do it we can writealgorithms I can do it right but ourintuition stuff for example go back andlook upstream some sparrows which is avery interesting paradox that comes frombasically our inability to put togetherstatements that are mystical in Judaismit's not a paradox in the sense thatthere is some math goes wrong which Ivery much because people think how canit be okay I'm typically logicalparadoxes but now the logic is not thatlikely to have a better box becausetruth functionality is much moreintuitive that's for everythingokay keep that in mind okayfinally inference okay so what I'm goingto do now is I know so here's thesituation my knowledge base contains aRC one sentence or they are sealed othersentenced are Bihar Marcy so that meansmine always the conjunction if onealways has two sentences that means itis a conjunction of those two sentencesand they're both in the novel's okaygiven theis it true that their army is also fivemovies can I be sure that they are P isdefinitely beyond something thisquestion is similar to a and B is trueis a truth that you knew quite quicklyanything is true of course it's true butthis is exactly the same way but youcan't quickly computers that's why youneed some sort of a mechanical wavecompute a difference so that's what wedo in three different ways first we justcompute the truth table and directly usethe definition that means you look atthe sets of words where the knowledgebase is true and make sure each of thosewords half is also true if so it is easythat's the first type the second pipe Itake alpha would have implication addedto the knowledge base then I computethis big sentences truth value in eachof the words if it is false everywherethen it must have been the case thatalpha must have tea until the third isthe proof theory influence such as usingresponse for instance people get whatare you saying so that's what I'm gonnado okay so this one the first time againI'll go quickly you should be
