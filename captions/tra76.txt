the one-shot attention problems areuseless they are actually useful in somecases but there are much less complexand much less interesting on the wholethan sequential reasoning where everydecision can potentially affect everyother decision doesn't have to worrygood okay okay so that's just one thingso anyway so ancient functions isbasically we are trying to write aprogram that once this agent whichthey'll say how to kind of look at theperceptible engine which is theobservations and then compute the actualdata to do so the function takes asequence of ourselves not just thecurrent percept because remembereverything that you've done before isalso relevant in deciding what youshould do nextright so it takes the percept sequenceand then it makes it as an action andmonitoring point of course is will saypercept sequence which is the sensoryobservations in the worlds where thestate is completely observable thesequence of percepts is actually asequence of steps in the words where itis not completely observable thepercepts are actually giving you onlypartial information about the states ofthe word you had done and yet you haveto decide what I'm actually isn't okayso animated program essentially istrying to compensate for subsequencesinteractions that's itthat's all the program you know you putsubsequent is about to enact such thatamong the whole set of such agentprograms you want the one that will beoptimal with respect to the performancemetric that has been provided okay sothat's what an intelligent agent designis okay now so in terms of agents youknow what he taught rational agents as Isaid an agent basicallylooking at history after parsecs thatit's been given it's not just the onestage not just what happened after thislast action it's what happened up untilnow okayand this targets liquids decisions andthen I actually evaluate the agent I tolook at the sequence of the states thathas come through in fact one smalldifference the agent may well look atonly the percepts but me from outsideokay then look at the real States it hasgone through because I might knowexactly the state to that country and Ido get all the states it has gonethrough and then give it you know thissequence I look at this equation and sayokay this is the level of yourperformance yesso this flight is actually aboutperformance that is externally evaluatedperformance of the agent the number thatthe agent was taking for sub sequencesdeciding action so it takes that's a p 0a 1 PT 1 a 2 P 2 a 3 and so on okay sowhat if that was even the case whereactually the world is completelyobservable this p 0 P 1 P 2 X apart ins0 s1 s2 exit when it's not observablethey're just different their partialinformation about the stage but whenit's being evaluated an external agentis looking at the performance and it'slooking at the actual stage which isdone did you see what I'm saying to getyourself into this morning imagine youdon't have eyes imagine you are blindand imagine you're deaf maybe you alsoprobablyyou know smell sense etc lots and lotsof samples so maybe bad but five sensesso maybe you will see you're color blindfor example ah you don't have longdistance so what you see what the worldis essentially the percepts thicknessright now if I'm trying to get you whohas these sensory limitations andcompare your performance somebody whohas no sensory limitations they see whatI'm saying I will still look at thestates that you have gone through howmany times are you guys banking yourhead against the wallhow many times are you tripping how manytimes are you falling into people allthese states I can see you cannot seebecause you are not you until it happensyou may not have see so you would havedone an action that may have made youtake the other guy who does an actionand to make sure that they wanted thisyou're I'm saying so the actual statesthat other guy has done who will bebetter scape so they will get a higherperformance you would get a lowerperformance this is true we as acivilized society try to reduce thatinequality especially if there arecongenital ah you know defects aboutblindness and deafness except we try tomake things accessible but it's clearthat reaching and level of performanceis harder but people who don't havesensory information they have the beforewe do so yes we are thinking about it ifsomebody trips somebody with full eyeside trips and falls it's great fun weshould allow somebody blind trips andfalls you laugh everybody the reality isyou're not saying so there is anexpectation that the guy who had theeyes could have seen that able to tripwould have made a decision that couldhave sparked that fall bozo did not sowe get to LAsomebody who can't see could not havemade a better decision it requires acertain level of citizen to laugh atthat is what I'm saying yes no there isthere is no such thing as complete andpartial environment it's the environmentthat you have okay and the performancemetric that you have okay we will talkabout by the way this blind deaf aspectsa little more in today's class becauseit actually in fact one of the beautifulthings about this course reallyespecially thinking about alleged aliensis it gives you humongous number oflessons about day to day life it's stuffthat you kind of most normal people havealready internalize them most numberpeople hopefully didn't have to be toldthat they should laugh when applyingperson trips although they're completelyfinelaughing when the teacher tripsespecially if the teacher is not runningit right so my point is you know thisalready and we can make sense of this inthe context of you know the agentperformance as measured by outside worldforces agent performance as measured bythe inside the agent itself when we madethe decision in methylation with respectto the facts it had and this necessaryinformation is we see it has a limitedinformation okay yes[Music][Music]yeah so what happened that's a very goodpoint actually if this becomes by theway maybe of this question one of theproblems with this discussion here thisif you can replace this lecture multipletimes during the semester it makes moreand more sense okay so one of theinteresting things that we just asked isimagine when you do an action it's notpredictableyou don't know exactly what will happenafter the action is done so I'm about totoss a coin what will happen you can'tpredict it and yet you have to decidenobody you know people do make adecision right who gets to play you haveto trick which which side the coin comesright you can say no no that's astochastic action let the coin fall Itell you which one I wantwhy is that not reasonable it's notreasonable because you need to make thedecisions to see the outcomes after theoutcomes all you can say is whether ornot somebody lived a reasonable lifethat's all but if it's your lifeyou have to live the life you have tomake the decisions with the incompleteinformation that you have at that pointof fact it's an extremely importantthing we live in a world in generalwhere you at any given point of timeonly how many partial information aboutthe world you have and you have to makedecisions based on them and it's veryhard to make those decisions that's whywe need to be doing and you could make adecision that a posterior II might looksilly okay but you you have to make thedecision to see the outcome you can'tvery well say I wantchange my lane until I go what willhappen after I change the level you domake the changes and see a huge crashbehind you you can say sorry okay that'sall you need that's how we liveit's a very interesting point to keep inmind in fact just because we say this ornot say that there is a distinction butin every in had a couple of classes wewill get to something called myfoundation processes MVPs and there aremultiple types of MVPs one is calledfully observable Markov decision processother is called P or MVP partiallyobservable Markov rational process themain difference is in the case of onlyobservable when you are about to take anaction you don't know what will happenbut after the action you know exactlywhat happened in the case of partiallyobservable you may not know what happenswhen you are about to take an action youdon't know what happenedthis will be like playing blind chanceclick speed where you basically closeyour eyes and play chess and that's whatblack people are actually to someaccident doing in the world they aremaking actions and sometimes they won'tnecessarily rightly understand what theoutcome after action is it's not like ohI was blind when I was making the actionnow I get to see what happened that'swhat you get to do they don't get to dothat they have to live in a partiallyobservable world and here to reach theirgoalsokay that's why they liked it muchharder than yoursokay so anyway so you look at thehistory and then we apply some functionto the speech whatever the function thefunction is that performance metric sofor example as a society we have decidedthat everything all that matters is howwealthy you are and you are 32 years oldthat's it that's the performance metricby that performance metric which can beapplied to this because s 30these are skates at every year on yourback Adelle exit so s35 how much evermoney you have on that in thatparticular statethat's your performance measure by thatJeffrey Epstein was amazing success butit can also be a different performancematrix how much money you had when youdied on that day after death that's alsonot necessarily a good performancemetric that could be somebody'sperformance they are they could be totalamount of you know some average amountof money you havewhy even money average a lot ofhappiness you had all of these aredifferent different kinds of performancemetric but they can all be applied tothe state secrets the important thing isif you think in terms of state sequenceswhich are the trajectories and yourealize that performance is a functionof the trajectories that you put that'sjust a short hand along the handnotation for saying the value of yourlife is your entire life if you keep onbeing mean to your friends and one dayyou can $1,500that doesn't necessarily make you a niceguy for some people at any rate becausethey might say you know those manybusiness know Roger 1500 this is notgoing to cut it I $30 is not gonna liethat's it is through performance metricswe have about okay now here is the otherinteresting question the specific statesthat you go through a fix after yourlife is over I know exactly the statesyou have got you the problem is thatactions you do in the world you are inthem because of the incompleteobservations as well as because theactions can be stochastic that means youdon't know what affects theyou did what you thought was the bestpossible thing and yet you went into astate that was really bad in your lifedid you see what I'm saying so forexample a fireman by woman City is aparticular you know the house on firebasically it tries to say that we shouldjust run in and then say the little kidthat looks like a good action it may sohappen that while they were trying torun out the whole building collapse of aman died the baby died and after thefact we realized that it wouldn't firstof all some other fireman may not havehad that bad one performance should notbe decided based on luck summons shouldbe decided based on whether you thoughtI did not think about the problem notbased on your life how do you deal withthatconsider expected performance if theegypt's decisions were done multipletimes it might have had multipledifferent outcomes it only use one lifebut it could have have multipledifferent outcomes okay so you canessentially look at the decisions thatthe agent where not just the States butthe action city and then see if theseactions were done by somebody else onthe average what would be theirperformance that's the expectedperformance a rational agent will try tooptimize the expected performanceyou cannot optimize the performance thatyou will get just for your lifeespecially given how the uncertaintyagain is a very complex idea tounderstand you do this in your life butyou probably think about it right forexample otherwise what's the pointsome people study studystudying for the exam some people justshow up for the exactly and you know insome cases inside process probably notthis class the people just showed up forthe exam might get it might actually dofine whereas the person who studiedstudied studied freezes during the examand doesn't remain so is that supposedto be that studying studying studyingfor the exam is a bad policy on a goodpolicy you have to consider that interms of expectations not just whathappened to one specific person andsomebody said honesty is the best policywhat did they mean it will mean that isan honest you never actually ever inyour lifeget everybody in of course you will geta body but on the whole in a lifetime ofbeing honest versus dishonest honesty isa better policy expected performance inthere it's a much harder thing to graspbut that's what an agent can optimizefor religion cannot optimize first stuffthat it can control the thing you cancontrol is I am going to pass a pointwhat I can't control is what it willcome whether it comes heads or tailsokay so you will only be seen as a badagent or a double agent or an unhappydivision change it if you did notexercise your choices correctly in thecontext of the information betweendinner that's the beauty of this littledefinition okayokay so we basically talk about agentsin terms of the perception again actionsthey get goals they have and even eventsand so some examples will grow faster mafor example the taxing agent perceptsmight be some video information that'saffirmative information that they enjoyit was using sensors GPS informationExeter these are now concepts that it'sgetting the types of actions in debtsteering accelerating braking using onspeaking displaying you know the kind ofdisplays that you are particularly goodat doing you know driving that you arefingers those are actions okay those areall the actions you get it goals safetyreaching this mission maximizing profitsover in large passenger comfort theseare actually sometimes conflicting ghostin fact if one of our driver gets you toyour destination three full minutesahead but you have to hold your life inyour hand it are the guy the woman wasjust believing through the traffic andalmost starting two different differentaccidents but you're three minutes aheadof time I maneuver driver areessentially basically events so slowthat there was no accidentbut you reach tomorrow and the third youportray us about in some sort of a tradeup which will use the question is whoseperformance would you like againremember that performance metrics areset by the designer if you are into slowI mean if you are you want to you canalways get in you know is a private carat that age you know by all means takeyour time I just don't want to ever havea probability of greater than point zerozero five that we can get into anaccident so there are basically mightcome up with apology that involvesmaking two or three feet of travel Fnight midnight stopping again again forthe next midnight the morebecause there is no traffic at that timethere is much less no chance of accidentsubscribe but that's human performancemetric Aniki okay so these are so howthese goals are combined into a singleperformance metric is essentially a gamedesigner specific okay we tend to thinkthat our society has a particular ideaabout this but it's not necessary youknow that we all agree okay so these arethe goals of course and the incrementsfor that cause of course would behusband streets previous trafficpedestrians whether customers all thispart is part of the engine slipperyroads hurricanes everything is pardonokay so the one interesting thing that Iwant you to think about is how does itaffect the complexity of the problem therational agent faces let's start offtalk about it in a qualitative sense ifI don't help ourselves if I have veryincomplete informationwhat does I have a lot of informationabout the imminent how does that affectthe performance you would think forconcepts we have give you a chance tohave higher performance if you have nocore sets you have a chance to havelower performance but I wrote somethingelse here performance is not equal tothinking cost if you get the trafficsometimes it's very mind-boggling youhave to look at what's going on the bestway to go fastest was your eyes and justgo I just do it is there I'm saying thatdoesn't hurt your brain is hurt it mighthave your upper body because there's ahard way but you can't hurt your brainyou know what I just said you canactually say that closing your eyesmakes your life easy in terms of theamount of thinking you have to do Emmacomputation you have to do but themoment you have fewer sensors the amountof the level of performance you can getto is limited these are two verydifferent things we tend to confuse themyou see what I'm saying sometimes youmight technical system we say wow thisguy is how you know which not as much asa password and I said as we don't seemto see the dirt in the environment andthey have a much happier life you knowif you have a roommate the roommate justmagically doesn't see any dirt is namein government he or she is having a muchnicer life than you you're wasting yourtime reading but unless you're humiditysetting herself a different performancemaybe if there is an externalperformance metric with respect to thatyou can prove that closing your eyescannot be a universally good strategy itwill always limit your upper upper limiton the performance you can get rememberone of the choices you can do is not touse yourself sighs that was your icecream pleasethat doesn't change the worldunfortunately I mean I never understoodthis nonsense of those monkeys whichclosed their eyes closed their mirrorsand just close their mouthsthose are stones there are monkeysbecause they're not actually interactingwith anyone okayyou have to track the development anddecide what to do what's the best trackuse dependent okay lack of actions makesperformance harder for example if youput in a car with a steering wheel talkat work remember the ones that you didin what is the order that is new worldwhen you are a little kid you feel as ifyou are in control but nothing ishappening because there actuallycontrolled by somebody else right sothere are more actions that you can takeif you don't take actions then you willhave ups limit on a performance comparedto somebody who has actions are takingon the same interval similarly if youhave complex goals that makesperformance harder because if you haveto kind of consider multiple trade-offsmultiple mutually configu trade-off thatmakes it hard to get a performance highperformance okay so it's kind of worthwhile remembering and the most importantthing I hope you'll remember is thisdifference between external performanceand computational cost okay like havinga good night sleepI'm going to say moving and having agood night sleep if it's much lesscomputational studying cast before theexam you would have a you know seriousmind by the next morning but that smilemight change after the exam right okayso then how about the environment so theenvironment itself actually again isconnected to all of these so the actionsthat I have may be instantaneous themovement a good action the effect isobserved a directive I made this actionafter a bunch of time the effect isobserved in the real world both kinds ofactions are there if you want to forexample think of very much it's trueeverywhere actually but you know thething that comes to my mind is the factit tries to control economy he'll dosomething they've change the interestrate that's an action it doesn't quiteeven have any impact it takes a wholebunch of time for you to reallyunderstand what it's badso those are curative actions the moreimportant one is deterministic was astochastic if you do an actionfor doing the action you know exactlywhat the state would if you know thecurrent state and it was thedeterministic action then before doingthe action you know exactly what thestable and then you do that to thatstate will have stochastic means beforedoing the action you only have a partialinformation about what states might beso for example when I'm about to toss acoinit might come heads it my campaignsthat's uncertainty and the uncertaintycan be quantified in the case of tossinga coinit might come heads exactly if it's afail fine heads down 50% of the timetail 50-person otherwise if it is a meanif I ask point the head might come youknow I was no but I mean Monday is my$10,000 if it is a completely past timewhich has had some both sides X willcome hundred percent of the final thingswill come zero possible arrived that's adeterministic coin right I mean thosethey're not Indians the surely a quorumis a deterministic way okay and so talksabout the deterministic was thestochastic distinction in terms of theenvironment it may be static or dynamicstatic means the economic waits for youto do actions it's in a state and widerus deciding what action to do it justwaits for your patient then you do theaction there in our state changes that'swhat static means anything else isdynamic that means if the economicskeeps changing while you are trying todecide what your next action is thenit's a dynamic environment it's muchharder to live in a time looking aroundin a static environment because statican already said then I already stoppedI'm going to go start my computerprogram three days later I will say thisis the actionso just without time limits for exampleis easier right because you can takeforever to think of what your nextmovies when I was going on a three willthat's an unbreakable element if youdon't make a decision somebody is makingthe decision for you okay observable waspartially observable that's adistinction okaythese the environment state observableto you or not and it actually isconnected to some extent observable waspartially observable is connected toperfect versus imperfect sensors so anenvironment might find much theobservable for most agents but not toyou because you don't have ice at let'ssay so accommodation of your sensors andwhether or not the environment isinherently observable or not mightdecide whether the agent knows what thecurrent state of the element is beforedoing the action only if not it'll onlyknow is not of a distribution or thestate of the world you might think Ithink it might be the state M state 1with 0.5 property state to it point toproperty state 3 with point D problem sothat's basically knowing lessinformation than complete informationand which can be any of these statesthen you have to consider any of thesethings have you know being important anddecide that what actually so if you wentto your doctor and you said I have thiskind of a a complex pain in my chest orsomething and they're trying to decidewhat action to do whether to give thismedicine among our operation or one onon you those are the three actions theymight explore to the point of course itis possible that just based on thesymptom they don't knowabout your diseases and it is possiblethat the medicine that they give mightcure you if you have the disease andkill you if you don't have the diseasein fact there are many such medicineskill you I'll get you closer to thedeath like for example you don't reallynearly go and get some kind of someamount of chemotherapyeven though chemotherapy is a good tipfor people with cancer it's a good thingbecause with instead of dying withcancer chemotherapy at least research umchance of surviving the cancer you justgo and give some symptoms that are sortof may be consistent with cancer I startdoing chemotherapy on you then inessence basically that will have anynegative consequences that so when youcan't with symptoms I have to realizethat this much chance that you haveactually this disease and a lower chancethat they are okay otherwise of us atthat point I have two possibilities oneis decide what action to do I've decidedmore tests tests are actions to in theu.s. you get more testswhy because insurance essentially youwill pay for the tests and if they evermake a decision that whites are beingwrong in your single case even for adoctor who had expected performance overa lifetime very high but in your singlecase some actual they did essentiallywound up you know and a families in youor something you would sue them are mostlikely it is not you your friends yousue them and they will lose gazetteeramount of money so the doctors know thisand so let's say let's do as many testsas possible because the tests are paperbefore making a decision sometimes thatthe rational thing depending on how theperformance metric is
