and if I put that eye in there andbefore they like mediate with us youknow cause I was in the power directionyou see what I'm saying and then I putthis guy to give peace I remember and Idid that by putting it me so what I'mgoing to do right now is actually okayso here is a simple planning problemsteps so you have a very simple kind ofin the four states you want eh Julieanother of two actions a1 which takes emand gives P I'm not them and a2 whichtakes em first initial state Emma a nottrue I need to have some secret from hisactions a1 and a2 okayby the way one of the interesting thingsis planning it's not required that aplant contains only one instance of aparticular action sometimes you may haveto a 1 a 1 a 1 5 times okay but thequestion is is there a sequence that youcan make out of a variety that we're notquite from the initial state to the goalStatejust think of the two simple sequencesa1 a2 are you okay would I ever need towork people see this directly on whatyou see this so there is a solution forthis problem you should be able to dothis operation way and professionally toexam problemsthe last one is doing it to the planspace way which is exactly what I saidwhich is I will spot a be viciousactually give me posted action G suchthe initial state has all the effects ofinitial stages Eminem so basically itgives them time and whilst achieverequires P and Q perfect I think I'll gostraight at services sync action so torealize that she requests BR q I willremember that you had G and B a Grequire right these are an openconditions if a plan has open conditionsit's still partial and it's not a timeif you have open task list of things todo or something sounded picked up you'renot done yet okay so open functionsfound a slaw and if you have anintention father you're not done yetthen the planning works is you pick oneof the flaws is now you only have ourprevention plans to pick one so in thisparticular case I've decided to make qng consider all the basis of making sureto achieve in that fashionit can happen in putting an action whichgives you are if initial said it stillgives you and it's already there they'rejust using what is there already youhave a custom booth what is fastdefinition you're ready adding in blueby the bringing and you got to help withthis I will ask an existing employee whodispatch to mr. Hansonokay so then basically I am in thisparticular case I only show you onebathtub something some wipes you have tocancer other paths to do the searchbecause if I never get to the solution Iwill just go through that 101 okay sothen I will essentially put a 2 a 2and then I remember that they do has tobe pure to achieve so if it has to keepyou to Jeanit better be coming before she you can'tgive stuff to people unless you comebefore them and they try to come after Ibecause nobody can come before I varybetween other okay so what I did was Iput in into and I put dishearteningdishonouring and I remembered that a tois giving to you this one is found apuzzling and it's just a bookkeeping youremember why you have the surprise ahumor have hired to do this pass for meokay and then I also problem is when Iput it into as a precondition itrequires M hiding a poison I believethat is C to see them it might be waterthey might replace all that stuffpromise okay but you have never satisfythem those are preconditions so this guyrequires a to request em so I just thisone I have this open condition and Ialso have yet cheese the open conditionpure cheese no other no contentionbecause it's been supported by a castleokay at that point I will continue andthey're not this point I want what canbe achieved s it then or what can phgeither then previous upper da1 whichgives meso I put a 1 here right here and it hasbecome before chief it has to come afterI stop now I have no reason to make abecome either before or after 8 p.m.cest this Basha returning is also calledthe least commitment plan you only otherthings and it's desperately needed youbring in people only when they havesomething usefulok so now it a one is giving energy andthen requires em right request em so Ihave to I am fat a one at this point Ihave a one is a verbal condition I haveat least our conventions likemy class becomes new then I'm done nowin addition to having open condition busyou can have unsafe link box it is youthought this guy will be supporting readthis guy and this other guy comes herewho is good to delete and this guy isnot added so you could potentially comein betweenthis is a disruptive employee if thedesert the advice we taken care ofyou hope you will be like you boughtwhen it's not beautiful so my questionthen is is that happening hereokay so in fact we continue father itturns out that it yet happened actuallyand so I can essentially and nothingmore because I everybody is havingbefore it I did not do anything fun atthis point I will notice that a onebasically gives em right ever gives emare you sleeping and to hear a speechstand right now everyone coming betweenI had a dream that be true okayand then at that point I need to resolvethe unsettling clocks open traditionsthe way you resulted is uniquely youguys and you use existing guys to helpwith attention but I'm simplyclass-based disruptive apology you getthem for disrupting our body out of theregion of disruption dissonance a sobasically I need to make sure that M isprotected between INATright and this case would kill em so youshould be either coming here answer bothone is come fromit's called emotion it turns out nobodycan come before rightso the promotion French can be generatedand the devotion branch is what I wannabe using here okay and at this point wecan establish an had a one at that pointthere won't be any open tension clasp onsettings this is[Music]that may be sufficientokay let's get this done okay so thisyeah[Music][Music]mm okay so this is four five six sixdeath the solutions are kept a secretyep but this is systematic search but ifyou understand the motion of loss youcan in some doing systematic search youcan do a climaxes specifically in yourselected a special plans so you don'treally need to remember how you cut tothat plan you only have to rememberwhich means the mouth is actually notimportantthis is what I'm saying the past is notimportant just like the nest is sad theassignment is matters them how do wemeet you assigned doesn't matter inwhich case you can start with a partialplan and estar 60 meters that would beinside okay I just tell you that youcould start with initial fan and youknow make up some plan and are you startwith some plan that you think will haveall the actions are all sort of detailbut you don't know the harder they andtheir preconditions at a time and thenyou start fixing you will see the numberof interaction in the plan the opentensions are selfies and then decide buteach you know pick a lock able to reduceand then see if you reduce in aparticular way how when you come fastit still so in fact the kind of changesjust like you keep our bearings in theSAP assignment here you can eitherthrowing an action bar you can remove anot being output in an arm from eachother you can see you know what is themaximum amount of glass that will stillremain and weekly and pick the onechange that seems to increase thephosphorus this idea actually mean downand is a powerful enemy he exactly worksthat way and basically it is very usefulto understand that you can fix plantswithout having to think in terms ofgoing from initial state to for stateand for state interest now in theTreasury question what in MDPterminology does this remind you ofsearching directly in the space ofpolicies instead of searching in thespace of values have some weakconnections are interaction about beConnections Academy is a usefulconnection to kind of keep in mind theparticular this idea is kind ofthe difference is the gradient thegoodness is completely being is decidedessentially you know the question twentynow that in my research is to be how doyou what is your goodness function andthe changes in the policy gradient tendto be decided by the gradients you havethe changes being decided by which onereduces of hospitals it's a kind of agradient descent it's a kind of verifybut instead of useful to understand asas borrow as plan space search he looksthis actually you won't likely toremember this idea because in some sensethis is how you do plants will Googlesearches but you're sort of stuck withsomething and it's all I need far moretime to support this goal this kind ofmarket on networks on could they bedifferent rules this is the kind ofstuff we do you know so it's not morenatural so it's a useful thing tounderstand and notice now that thenotion of the search state you know whatthey the water state into the searchteam in a star search example searchright now the super solid state changesbetween class space better if I guessoperation the search state is a completeworld state in this case of theChristian it is a partial state in thatcase of this planet it is a partial planit's just a set of constraints onactions the constraints are basicallythe residence the streets and the causallink on screen now here's an interestingquestionnotice that when you read class thisplanning without things like this beforewhen you do prohibition also you willkind of have maximum than here - then atree etc they are the harness machinesemantically other coordinates the sameI want you to understand that thisauditing is what's called fact acuityimmediatelyin operation search then into is appliedafter day one that means nobody else cancome in between like that there's no Sunbetween them so I can teach you the artwhereas remember what happened when wedid the black space search up until herewe basically thought you will be comingbefore G and then we actually put a oneto come before a kanji so other otherlinks are presidents links there arecontinued innings this is how again youtake the thing I do this task and then Ido this task and then is not immediatelythere so if you need to do another taskyou can put it in between these noticedpop-up and the president's this is whatpartial are doing is our power say whatI'm saying if they one has to precede atwo that means any real execution wherea one comes some number of steps beforeyou do it whereas if a one should beimmediately before they do then the onlyexecution of that will be consistentwould be rarely one is done right onthank you for it it's useful to thinkabout so basically you can say thateverything is really plan spaceeverything is actually masters plan whatpublishers that was doing it wassearching in the space of the fixeshourglass the crucial search issearching the space of suffixes ofadvanced search which actually meansthat you can come out of the otherin fact there's an old paper that Iwrote this shows that you can actuallyyou know one level do black space searchthen okay but it's much more useful foryou just think of them as differentsearches okay looks like okay couple ofthings in the few minutes that we haveleftbasically is first of all understandthat in this case so nobody ever talkedabout complexity of a star searchbecause any problem can be written as ana-star search for we did talk aboutcomplexity of stack because of LisaDiMarino said many other sacrilege areright the question is what is thecomplexity class of this kind of planinterestingly it turns out that it'sactually a harder than and B commuteit's what is called this pyramidyou can have at least one instance whichhas all of it in thereit's a painful problem tonight in factthat's the reason why all these culturescame up with all these stories thatthese briefs in another's place areslowly taking these 64 hours I amfollowing the rules giving to the thirdthing and given the priestly taking gateof this and their time the world willcome to an end but it turns out thatessentially for 64 the 64x64 is thesefor this how to make to power 64 movesand you know howso they take their own sweet time so wedon't need to worry about any time butremember that our is the classic case ofa problem where the input size and thesolution line are exponentially relatednow I will tell you that you can fightour family problem for any number ofthis as just like you need the one therewhich then tells you that since that guygives you because that guy isexponentially large solution it's not aperson anymoreand it turns out the exact year forapproach saying it is the hardestproblems that can be done in polynomialspace what is what is it possible to dothis in four manual states computationhas to have in common our spacedepth-first search for search will takefour number space can you solve PattiCochrane depth-first search yesso there exists not an mp3 so that'skind of a useful the constant that interms of the hardness of the problemsunderstand the problems SAP is envy andaction planning but if you say is therea plan of a certain length when you givethe length up front of the inputparameter there needs to be a and inparticular this is a strange thing ifyou are askingbounded thank planning problemsis given an initial state on both stateis there a plan of legs is Dean that ishow this ball I only care about plansare two legs will be like this it willbe that we complete now you know whatelse is np-complete we just say that soin theory you should be possible toreduce planning and the two you chooseplan into a cell phone see what I'msaying and in fact that next book tellsyou a particular plan which was numberthe same guys will be G sad and weresaid and what they do is they group fora length of the plan and it set up ahuge sack Theory whole bunch of closetsthat if you can find a model for them Ican convert that model there back HalleBerryso the same problem many different waysof solving it different setups one ofthe advantages of converting it is aproblem is you don't need to write yourown planning under them because peoplewho are out there trying to improveSachs our search like every year becausein turn case about how fast as apharmacist on this what I'm saying so ifyou can convert your cognitive into aproblem the other people are desperatelytrying to be please efficiency are thenyou can just see the easy-chair andassume thatokay so that's father okay and then thelast couple of things I want to mentionis basically the question one of thequestions is some cool interactions areimportant in terms of heuristics forplanning the question will be have theinteractions between the supports andtrying to relax those interactions anduse them to fight sounder power rememberhow the heuristics comes from an a-starsearch and solve abstract version thissolutionyou a lower boundary are the twosolutionsI'm sorry gonna use it at the unity sothe question then is what do you relaxand it turns out that the right thing torelax for planning is interactionsremember I talked about independentsupport and positive and negative givesa cute way of understanding them so if Ihave two goals are independent if I havea plan of like equable one left and fouropen 24 - I can just concatenate them inany order and the pants are you knowhave one mole to the 30 lengths backokay if it is positive interactive thatmeans the battle plan for G 1 and G 2might be less than 30 because we one ofthe walls probably helped you do anotherof the course party if it's negativelyinteracting then the length of a plan G1 and G 2 can be between album a plus ndo indicated andinfinity you see why infinity ispossible because I can ask you to solvea goal with Jeeva the goal is G 1 and ajiiva tabuwatch even I am NOT able to eat withthem so you come up with a plan for youtoday59 the plan for G not even before whatyou got to take together because thereis really no plan B you go G 1 or noteven the new length of the plan for thatmay be negative infinity since theinteractions that make planning searchhard and what heuristics why should wetry to do is essentially relax theseinteractions improve interactions and soI just so that the simplest rhombusrealistic just so that you haveOctober 1 this a difference you historyyou're doing professional search let'ssay you have a current state where youare and the goal state whether suddenthings to have some memories you can seehow many of the poles are alreadyholding the hands okay and if in factalcohols are holding then it's unitycost is zero because it's not equalstate if there are 15 pores and 14 areholding its realistic our past is 1 andso on this is constant difference meansthe whole state and the current stateI mean how many of the goals that youwant to achieve are not already it's alittle the interesting question since wespent so much time talking about herethis tits and at least we is this nippleshould escape it missing and he is itofficialfirst let's talk about officials is itin swamp is it a good heuristic like forexample imagine that two goals you haveget an a-plus in this class exam - I'llgive you a plan which said by the dipolealready one goal is satisfiedanother plan which says huge number ofactions to try to get you a plus thathas no typos by this heuristicboth of these plans are equally distantfrom the world but if you think thoseare true then you're in big troublebecause some both are much harder toachieve than other words and just sayingthat the number of bones arein fact because of pitch it's a badunity it's not any families the questionis indeed at least admissiblethey were got that last time we packedup with a fabulous trip in H equal tozero a good thing going for it was it'sa it's a visible difference realistic itvisible no you see what I'm sayingbecause it is possible but g1 and g2have positive interactions and in factwhile g1 requires one action a1 it alsogives you t do you see what I'm sayingso the difference so the number ofactions required to get you and hetogether is just one which
