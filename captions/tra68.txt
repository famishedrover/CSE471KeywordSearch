okay so we found that Manhattan isbetter than Indians from their habitatnow here's my other thing can I getbetter you know even the textbookthey're not about ghostswhat can I get even better heuristicslike the one that I did for the hotclimate problem by for example I wentfrom circular approximations topolygonal approximation that could bemore important while still beinginvisiblewhat can I do for money no time puzzleswhat I can do for my puzzles is thefollowing if I'm trying to compute thedistance between these are this in stockwithout misplaced identity you don'tthink I would say you notice that I putsome piles in red here's an ideasuppose you're outside of the class Iwant to put you back remember where youare that's your actual configuration andToyo oxide the class I want to put youback into your oasisand imagine if we were some needs to bewalk todayI would argue that the total task that Ihave to spend in watching every one ofyou to your places which is what I'mpositive we will be at least as much asthe cost I will spend trying to walk allthe women to their places this is notPatrick I'm just telling you that womenare a subset of all the classactually in my small subset that's only30 of you okay and if I could all 30 ofyou in your right places and I count howmuch time in terms of that that'sdefinitely what I am spending gettingall the rest of you this is what I'msayingso you they basically outside you find apattern in this case the pattern happento be denied all I can say what happenedis let's put all the lies with how thepeople is wrong here into their placefirstand then we put the recipe and myheuristic would be just counting theCasta getting these distinguished peopleinto their places and I'd only computethat cast in doing so remember where weare I did I had other people justbasically the rest of you don't matteryou know when I am looking at thespecial ones so long as people are beingput it exceeds nominate people who haveeven distributionthey're just warm bodies that's patentdatabase so what I basically do here isI need to get this to this one this isthe holistic retirement estimator I willargue that in the final configurationdevotees these guys on the fridge theseare there are fridge whatever is thetotal number of moves I have to make toget all these dirty guysyes that would be little haunted bysound we discover where only things thatI care about other language the othertimes actually have room individuallyand so the difference between here'sanother error which was quite differentwhen they actually had numbers hypnoticdo you see what I'm missingnow this gives you a beautiful way ofcomputing more and more costlyheuristics for statistics because theywill be more informal reduce the timepotentially the number of roadexpenditure so really this is fatterdatabase exactly and I want to tell metwo things on that minute ago one isthis one you need to understand that youhave two different search whichessentially involves trying to computethe optimal distance into thisconfiguration and it turns out that'sgoing to be really costly search in eachstep it's not something like pluggingstuff into the founder particular thisis basically what happens what you woulddo is rather than compute each nodesdistance from the board room before youeven start the problem you compute theheuristic value solving and in one passthe way you do it is you start from hereand do that first search breadth firstsearch and whenever you get a newconfiguration that would be the firsttime you know see thatthat's the customer calculation amazingidea but it takes time to do this thepicture the pattern the more time it'sgoing to be that gets me to this lastthing that I want to show before we getin Vietnam where there are two kinds ofus which decide the total cost you spendper search one is the cost of heuristicthe other is that a spot search whenyou're using option to actually do thesearch then here we are past the user 6hstar will take as much time as theoriginal search but then once you dothat that search is that will actuallybe G so in this sense in a page ifyou're starting up the heuristics of atleast the most inform their cost isgoing to increase like this and for eachof them that asketh will search which nis a be reduced when somebody askswhat's the right level of abstractionthis is the pictureright essentially you have to figure outwhere they keep itand that's the best level halfway markmultiplicity one in the beginning forthe longest find people used to thinkthat this possibility to exist on thisside so they will assume that it will berealistic it should be something that isat most one solution I just plug it innow we are much smarter there are manyproblems here which is
