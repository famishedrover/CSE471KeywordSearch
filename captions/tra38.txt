that each of them there are interestingways of proving what is the right thingto do and for us essentially you standon a gradient to both branches for themax you send the gradient to water isthe maximum guy at that particular pointso max becomes a router of the gradientlast becomes a splitter of ingredientbut it's not nearly as negatives splitsand cents per minute both directionswithout reducing sirright so so I come here essentially I'msending this big in both here and hereand continue essentially this way andthen of course here I come here thisplus will attain that point to zeropoint two zero is your upset so I willstop or just biscuit by my point indoing this is not to get you to writethis program but to get you tounderstand that this is donemechanically in particular actually ifyou look at this you could actually havewritten this whole block if you were oneof the other things that computers do isthey do block structuring you could havewritten the sigmoid function the sigmoidK that at times it might gain as onesingle gig let's say their party saidnah that's a simple operation the harderone by 1 plus E power minus X andremember I told you what is thedifferential of 1 by 144 minus X if G ofX is 1 by 1 plus E power minus X thenthe differential is G of X times G of 1minus X just like once in your life youfigure out that F for no derivative of 1over X is minus 1 by X square similarlyonce in your life you figured this outso that becomes now this block now canessentially we shall put this thegradient comes here the gradient comesout just by putting in directly G of X G- f XA G of X times G of 4 minus X T seewhat I'm sayingthis is whatthe computation part of neural networksvery easy to some extent that gets us -so basically actually even shows thatand in fact you know if you just didthat you can either about this in thepast leave it the way we did earlierare you could have planted it in the 1by G of x times 1 minus G of 4 minus Xand 1 minus G of X and that gave me thesame exact numberthat's because math works by computersonce a night but so that was dead rightso the patterns in the multiplication ismore complicated having talked about itright now you can get the max isessentially a router in this particularcase you know this is month - so youcame up to here and this is - this isminus 1 the max of to 1 minus 1 is 2 soall the plus it is me this is whathappens if you look at the operative itdoesn't look like what you learned ingrade school but how many times how doyou think computers actually domultiplication the way you must do itlike that I know you put big number interms of the number and once you figureout the concept you can implement it ina way that is better for computersthat's what we want updated okaynow that brings us to why Jensen 1 isthe happiest man you know just upon hisrule he's the CEO of a media which wasan also-ran chip company he used to bethe only thing and that more oh I usedto be there tied and you know and mediais togetherthey are not much going for the EMT wasmaking computers and NVIDIA said theywill make graphics processing unitsgraphics possibility right and that wasmostly further for the screens basicallybecause each pixel has to be separatelyhanded and so it required a huge numberof download CPUs these CPUs don't haveto do much other than this multiplyingadding and then throwing down and thoseare like so you have mimosa beansthere are multi-core CPUs and you haveGPUs which are humongous for dumb GPUsadvanced in use which was mostly onlyused for showing stuff on the screensand and gave us were happy but then hegave us unfortunately if you'd like twoor three people to make money and gaveme the rest of the gamer services so whois going to buy these big GPUs right andso almost Nvidia was going out ofbusiness and then came right in timethis connection between doing this kindof brain-dead operationsmultiple of them I'm AI at what peoplecall di which is being able to do imagerecognition and so just someone like anygood capitalist and who simply wouldn'tgive me Lesliehe says always we know that barring a Icompany State University of Utrecht isthere I'm pretty sure he never did may Iposeyes okay but now is any I got and thiscompany is an Eric company and theybasically sell GPUs rich okay fineGPUs and West in history and the recentrepeaters make sense is because this isyou might argue that this might actuallybe the only similarity not cause havocbrains because individual gunas arepretty damn stupid you know they arebi-directional they're just stupid damnthat individual your arm something herethey were on their computer neuralnetworks but they don't do like you knowlet's just write Hamlet there's no havethat right in your on fireokay so individual neurons with verysimple operations massively parallel methis is what GPUs okay so we will stophere
