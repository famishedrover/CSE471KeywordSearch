enforcement learning the interestingthing about you learning is a part ofwhat we did this year just to avoidhaving to compute this aspirin downafter I taught the full values after Igot optimal values I still have to dothis step to convert the value functioninto policy so I felt I think that toopainful so instead I'm just interruptyou but you can put the following crazysituation somehow he would give you thisstuff just I'm gonna justuncle you whatever I just give you thisstuff you know now you have the V stuffyou just need to know what's the bestaction you can you convert it into thepolicy policy you would need thesenumbers you need to know what is theaction going to do in each state andthis actually in reinforcement learningtechnology this one is called atransition you can value-- into policyif you have the bottle you can camp orvalue of the policy what you have youdon't count model because of amenitiesare specified but it turns out we'll seethat in reinforcement learning in factmany of the approaches that what theywere quite directly learning the valueswithout ever knowing the model it turnsout there are two ways of solving theproblems onebut it is only four times bigger so justa city but when you go to when you gothrough reinforcement learning in whatof free learning is only one way ofconverting the value to policy which isto actually track the value function interms of two values rather than bebetter okaythe last thing that I want to say is thepolicy equation so you have the costevaluation I want to just give you theidea of policyiteration there are clearly only a powers colleges the sub-region food forceapproach for policy rate policy basedcomputing optimal policy Becca[Music]okay then I just said since you wentfrom PI to be PI now from the money togo to PI accepting you my - right so thevalue of you policy would becomeconverted value policy repeatabilitystate even a value the greedy policy forthe family would evaluate and youcompute the lily pond see it respectsthat fee if you kept the same boxy backis your mom down the one that I startedrandomly with is actually the optimalmercy it's not new policy[Music][Music]distal part even if you choose by theway I told you about the South set oflinear equations the guys swing valueiteration just two updateswhy am I supposed to solve equationsthat will be the harder problem just toupdate my one well it turns out you cando value computation also has a valueiteration has an update without the maxso basically what you divide up doing isinstead of this being equal you set thisas an update and you said basically bepart of s in some numbers willinitialize it and you keep updating yourretirement these updates are cheaperbecause there is no max operational workand this too is guaranteed to solve thelinear equations now if I said is mylevel it's a slightly betterapproximation deserving Meister ice andthen you do the next pass[Music]
