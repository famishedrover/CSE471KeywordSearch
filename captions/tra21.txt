Rose has number two I wonder Samba 3 andthe guy who said who obviously Heatherdoes not infinity right my decker numbermay still be finite because I wassitting where I was on this show somaybe there were some people who were onsome show with Kevin Bacon people knowKevin Bacon bacon number okay this wasso this sort of came much later butanyway the reason I brought up Taradouche is that you actually used to talkabout different proofs for the samething there are you know how many of youknow that there are like multiple waysof proving Pythagoras theorem like ahuge number like I think it's eitherWashington or Jefferson also showed upcame up with one truth it was like thething to do those days okay so thequestion then of course is of all theproofs which is the most elegant proofand so others would say if a proof isreally elegant it says it came from thebook so he had this idea that that godof mathematics has a book and and theygave their rules for every theorem andif you were able to get the same proofthat the God has them okay say thatsupport may not give you proofs from thebook but it's a proof computerized wayof solving mathematics gives you prettyugly proofs for tower theorem forexample has been proved using computersand it's like a million pages long othercomputers will look at it and say yeahlooks goodand people will say I think computersare happy let's leave them alone so lotof mathematicians still feel veryunhappy that four-color theorem isproved eight operators so that's kind ofuseful to understand that they needactually aesthetics I got proofs but youknow for logical proofs is it if this isnot proofs of you know world changing itback so you are essentially the same onthat proof is fine if it's something soone more heuristic is linearinput form strategyeven better this one says a free pair ofglasses that you have a result one ofthem must be one of the input glassesthat means the cards from the zero leveldo you see what I'm saying a pail of onethat's one of the must always be fromthe zero level it will reduce number ofresolutions to this one it's not lookingat the royal blood anymore it's eitherit basically says one of the guys thatyou're resolving it must always be fromthe zero together how many have you knowprologue a lot of music is linearconstant linear input form strategy isnot complete that means there can betheorems that approval but you missproving them okay so this is the kind ofso instead of a principle it will be socool we'll say this is incompleterealistic and this is completely asleepokay kind of nice to see that the a-starsearch that you know on love maybe notlove but at least know basically showsup in a slightly different form it's asearch and in the heuristics have aslightly different character okayjust as I said I will do I want to goback and show you this normal formso in logic there are actually multiplecanonical forms that means you can writeeverything in that canonical form forcomputer science for example they canmonitor for all your programs and thecanonical form which is Intel assemblylanguage every program eventually can bewritten compiled down into interest thelanguage you might be thinking of thisis fighter and this is seasomething that everything is eventuallyinteresting tonightand similarly logic everything for anyprogram you have a compilation thatparticular form will be called canonicalform okay so in logic there are multiplecanonical forms actually the two are oneis conjunctive normal form which isbasically CNF s-- and it is aconjunction of clauses of the time theyare looking yet that's called CNF sothis is the form we are looking for andthen also a disjunctive normal form DNSwill every clause in the conjunction ofliterals and they are disjointedtogether they both have uses we aremostly interested in the CNF one and thefact that I said they are canonical youkind of can see that any logicalsentence can be converted into them okaybefore I show you the actual way ofconverting it's useful since we are hereto talk about another form called theharm for harm logic harm odjickessentially is trying to capturesomething like this a and B and Cimplies B it's trying to capturesomething like that so it wants to beable to write all sentences inter ofthis form when was the last time you sawsentences like that those of you whosaid use no prologue from log writesentences like that it has a differentsyntax you can say it has representedsays D[Music]now it looks the same all right okaythat's real luck okay now it turns outthat hard buzzes essentially are therestricted form they are not canonicalnot everything can be converted intohard pluses in particularly we threwthat something remark was is this simpleidea that it is a CNS class which has atmost one positive literal a CNF classwith at most one positive literal yousee why because a and B and C implies Dyou convert this into class allit into the disjunction form it would benegation of a and B and C are deep neckregion of a and B and C's one boon isnothing negation of it abnegation of Bare negation of see these are insane sothere are three negative and onepositive there which account was TCM sayharm process are a restricted form andthey are essentially engineered suchthat all you will ever need to prove allthe theoremsit's your analogies in Harper's form ismodest ponens you do not need resolutionwhose you can get back with resolutionbecause resolution is the most generalform the people see this okaywhat does Probab use essentially columnuses mod exponents in fact in the dayswhen I did have to put one more terms offlow project for you guys so that youcan write it on your resume we wouldhave a project for writing alonginterpreter you know how to write aprogram interpreter at leastbecause you have a latina in front ofyou you see what I'm saying Turlock isnot just that because prologue also hasthis time operator which changes a bunchof things that's not going to that butthe pure prologue is supposed to be justhard cause theorem proving the beauty ofheart was theorem proving he is whileclear improving on Mahama logicaldatabases is going be complete thecomplexity for hard classes it's onlypolynomial okay and in general that'sbecause if you know what when we weretalking about resolution we mentionedthe fact that for resolution willinvolve case analysis remember theexample v game is either Tom comes tothe party of John comes to the party ifTom comes to the party love is happy ifJohn comes with the party always happyhe's wrong happy either John will comeif Tom comes are always happy if Johncomes running at me Robby the happy guyand the way through this is case one Tomonly comes always happyit's two John comes first in heaven soRobbie that case analysis modus ponensyou don't do case analysis you just dosome good it's a Buddhist appalling insome sense actually that way provideoperators work is to prove me you try toprove a and B and C and there may beother rule basically say if you can giveP and Q I can give you a so there toprove it you try to put th e and maybeyou are given P and Q to be true so thatpart of the proof three gets over thereand then you still have a few B and Cand you're voila means then you can justfight me it's a very simple non casethere is no case analysisthe same time say okay so it's useful toknow our fathers in this because that'sjust part of a matter of knowledgeinescapable anybody if you say you knowlogically then that's no reason harmfulokay in the case of if you write positthis way then for example a and Bimplies P or Q is that hogwash now ifyou said a and B implies field that's aheartless she said a and B plus PR q noit's not a heartlesseither you can see we are you canconvert it and realize that it isactually after form not a not b RT Rcube and in this class of lengths fortwo of them are negative polarity to orpositive polarity for something to be aharm cause you can have at most onepositive polarity you forget thedefinition is the definition but if youlook at the implication you know whatthe other side of indication thereshould only be one that city okay so itturns out this is also a canonical butit's a restricted canonical form thatmean it's not complete not everythingcan be converted into this but if youcan talk about your knowledge basecompletely no harm father's then youdon't do resolution there of goinginstead you do problem you would beessentially power change you would bechanging the last time people used towhen I first joined at ASU maybe foryour parents were born they used to tellme that the classes would have to bealmost held in a stadiumwhy because that was the expert systemsrevolution what is an expert system itwas a bunch of rules that experts knoware being usedin this ability and then putting theseroots together to flow arrowsessentially that's the theory ofexposition of course on top of it we canstart uncertainty then you get intoBayes networksso this basically most expert systemsfor doing this stuff backward andforward chaining what exponent rulestogether rule by definition is if thisis true this is true this is true thenyou have this typically nobody gives inthe rules of the comment this is truethis is true this is true that you havea piece of the service that's a harderkind of a group is what I'm saying thisis that systems so if your mate is thisis what you put on your resume okay butthat's for the hard classes so the lastthing I would point out in thisparticular case is to say thateverything can really become moreindependent in all of my kind of toldyou this more or less you can see thisbut here are some steps that tells youthat if you have to convert any tendencyto any proposition about the acceptanceinto a cross or five you just followthese steps lightly okay first removethe implication removing the replicationmeans if you have a twice B right itdoes not anything because implicationsare not existing in the classes then tointerpretation in so if you have a B theequation should only be applied to asingle proposition that's the idea ofpulling the negation here so you knowfrom your boolean logic that not of A orB is identically equal to not a and notB right okay so that's the pulling thenegation in then use demorgan's laws todistribute this change in ourconjunction so if you ever have a are Band Cyou can write this as they are bit andtake RC at this pointdrop the injection and say everything tothe one side of our connection is onepart next I'll connect with other tranceshe basically have two classes thereyeah be one part they are Caesar thisyou're insaneso you do this methodically it's apolynomial time you can compile anypropositional logic sentence into CNFform but that's the same thing yourcompilers take your C language yourPython language can go tearing throughSMD language and they can exponentiatetime you would be very unhappy okay okayso that's the conversion to CNF formsince that was Goku and you know how tosearch and I also last time and then youknow we talked about this one also lasttime I talked about the fact that youcan take a give an example a longerexample English sentences that aresalivating into propositional form andthen converted into a class or form andthen we did a bunch of resolutions Ijust showed a sequence of resolutionthat ends in empty class okay when youare doing it that's basically likesaying should be one path for a starsearch that ends to the goal so if Igive you a class a big graph and I saycan you give me a path to the book rightthen you are visible you can go frominitial step to this then this thenthat may not be the shortest path that'sjust a back so for us the goal is theempty glass I just need to give you asequence of resolution that land up inempty glass and I just gave you some youare not expected to have to do this notonly because ultimately a computershould run this process and find the anyclass but you know to see that you wantus to die yeah we will ask you to do itas smaller problems is what I'm sayingwhen do we need to feel bad if youcannot under time pressure find theright sequence that is happening inempty class that's what computers aregreatly okay but when you are underpressure it's one thing not getting theright answer but it's other thinggenerating wrong answers and soundresolutions they sort of say class classpeople start seeing emptiness aroundthem they can't find any differenceeverything is empty okay so some of thethings that normally people lose thefirst time around is first of all theyforget you know the notches is youshould first negate the goal beforeconverting it to the clausal form okayand the second is that you should if youhave PR Q and not P or not Q you have tosell it one little and resolve on it youcan't just say okay I'll take three ofyou and a few of you the whole thinggets cancelled I hadn't across thatactually makes no sense except in theexam or not a pressure in fact if youare able to get an empty class here is away of convincing yourself that youshould not have done this it's not thenext a dumb rule but you just have tofollow it's because if you want toactually convert your Q and not we arenot you and if you need to have aresolution what you saythe mood is fabulous a human okayyou are cute is cute okay ah if you takeit the other way wrong and you decidedto go with cue with everythingwhat is nice actually these two formulashold either in a world where P is trueare you know what when Q is trueimagine a world where P is true it isthis formula tooso P is true Q is false okay it isfather to meyes how about this formula so theconnection still true and you justfighting desperately finding an emptyclass where one exists we said these twoare inconsistent together it's not youare insulting by doing that they'reinsulting truth so that's the reason youshouldn't take P R Q not P or Q and if Mword immediately flies at the same timeokay so that's the other thing that youshould remember not to do that andthat's what basically is being shownokay nobody has to tell you this in maththere is a good way up there right we'redoing it ten thousand different ways ofdoing it I'm just telling you thisbecause this is one of the wrong waysthat made me put the many other onewhich I'm sure you will figure outyourself okayfor which you know if I just tell allpossible ways people make mistakes it'sgoing to take a long time so this is Xmore competency um I already mentionedcomplex their propulsion inference forthe full case propulsion inference isfor in the company that meansexponentially harder okay for the hardclass case it's polynomial that means ifyour knowledge happens to be in the harmform then it's formatted this actuallyled to a sort of a strange thingyeah at 1.5 which is what if even if youhave knowledge that actually is not inhuntresses form but you like contrastthey don't really because it's cheaperyou just remove the things that have nonhandler stuff so you say a and B and Cimplies P R cube a cube or may never bea and B and C implies P and class thisyour own and say this is the classiccase of human civilization like thetrunksearching for the last case under thelight you guys know this right first ofall all of science is awkward times likethisthe truck is searching for the key isunder the light and you ask you know didyou lose the keys here Mama Cass is alost somewhere there that's too dark soI'm searching under the light here okayso you're solving this you can put itthe knowledge that you know into a formthat it's not supposed to be in just sothat you can use the cheaper this is notthat different by the way from peopletaking pictures of SAP clauses that thisthing there are people who nowadayseverything should be done by seacalmness so instead of proving theoremstake a picture of the process I kid younot I'll send you a linkyou know Piazza and then submit it toyour accountant and see what happenssomething might happen sometimes you canactually get it replay I pay for in thisparticular case I hold my head in shameit actually went to be quickly I okaybut you know so if you are the firstcharacter imitate a previouslyyou will actually get the paper but thenyou will become notorious you will betalked about in the class okay so thecouple of things that I want to do forthe rest of the class include electionperiod is essentially talk about theapplications of propositional logic oneyou already saw theorem proving itinvolves search the other like kind ofnaturally satisfiability chicky I wantto imagine a little more about itbecause that's basically the same asconstraint satisfaction problems is mylast chapter separately for that but Iwant you to understand that you prettymuch know that theory is expectantfathersundeterred that I probably get into inthe extended period it is theproposition of planning which is youlike actions in terms of the conditionsand effects you given the goal stage asa bunch of propositions that have to bemade to an initial state is given interms of the propositional positivevalues and you put these actionstogether such that you reach the goalstate so this is essentially exactly astar search except being done in a nonatomic representation and the beauty ofit is you will see one of the great ideathat we need to see is why Muhammad astar such as R goes from initial stateto whole state you can also start fromyour state to initial state which youwould say it's not surprising except inthe world you never have specified goldstate company key this is what I'msayingyour current state is you are wearinggreen shirt length pants have long hairfight feeling sleepy etc etc your goalis to pass this class watch on are youfeeling that day I don't care I don'treally care if you're wearing it youjust have to pass the class you see onas I go also like that goals are givenonly partially initial state isdifferentthree words are given partial that meansthere are many many many real-worldstates there you could have passed thisclass you pass the class with long hairand red shirt you pass the class withshot in green shirt and you pass theclass more likely with really reallylong hair extremely sad face and samplesyou passed all of them are sounding moreok so the interesting question then ishow can you go when I know that thereare many different goal States how can Isearch from goal States towards theinitial state which goes straight to Isearch back from in the novel I startsearch if I say go from s to G those aretwo nodes in the graph you could havethe conference to G aren't you - yesit detects if it's a graph the way youwrote the a-star search G was actuallyan opaque procedure it will take itknown and say yes or no which alreadyactually allowed for the fact that morethan one state can be a goal statethat's what you always just render thepower direction but if you consider thisrepresentation we'll talk about how toactually generally do this reasoning inthe backward direction without changinganything that's that what did you getfor not being in atomic representationsokay so those are the two things thatI'm going to do first in the snapproblems Society so I I've neverrealized I mean I did go to high schoolyears you probably can tell from myaccent but so I just assumed that meansthis and so when I try to talk to Navajopeople on the street they'll say wellyou poor there you stood taking SATswhich you guys gotta saybut this is the nearest city okayboolean satisfiability problem whichreturns are as we mentioned essentiallyin the last class this is the kind ofproblem when you have a bunch of clausesand you're trying to find the truthfalsity values further variables suchthat all the clauses are satisfiedthat's it and I told you that one ideais essentially to have a systematicsearch where you start with one node andsome variable and then consider itstruth and falsity values and thencontinue so at any given node by thattime you have given some number of nodesthere values so for example if I'm hereI haven't even shown to be true time tobe true okay the question is if Joe andTom are both true c1 is by violatingwrite a return a single constraint isviolated you can kill that matchinsertion so this is the simplest ideaokay and I told you that you shouldnever do anything other than depth-firstsearch in these kind of problems becauseit's a finite tree how deep is thisdrivel to me what how deep is this treegoing to be of sale of no no I want anumberhow deep is thiswhat how many closets so he had takensomething so he says how many closetshere as deep as the number of classesanybody agrees with him number ofdifferent literalswhat are literals basically propositionsymbols so now we have two competingfactions some people think this tree isgoing to be as being in the worst caseas the number of clauses and some otherprison any one person thinks thateternity as deep as the number ofpropositions that are taking part inthis classes which side are you on oneof them is right propositions number ofpropositionsokay so in fact that the process by theway here is you know I should mentionthat this particular problem we arehaving it's a problem I said but it canalso be called a CSP problem constraintsatisfaction problem a generalconstraint satisfaction problemespecially a general discrete constraintsatisfaction problem basically has abunch of variables each of which havingtoo many which is the values they cantake and there's a bunch of constraintssaying if this variable takes this valuethis takes this value this guy cannottake this value that's what we do exceptwe're doing it for variables that areboolean that means their domain is justa true/false you see what I'm saying soin fact CSP is nothing but sad where thevariables have non binary you know themains are SAP is nothing but CSP wherethe variables havevalues okay so in some sense I'm alsocovering the CSP chapter so later on youknow if you want to know whether or notyou have any idea about CSP this isbasically the process you can see yesboolean satisfiability problem which isif you have given a bunch of satisfiedto take classes and checking whetherbunch of propositional clauses okay inthe you think in terms across all fourCNF was all four okay thenchecking if you can find the truthfalsity assignment through all thevariables such that all the way mouthsclauses are satisfied that is called aboolean satisfiability problem thequestion is how hard is it to do andwatch Steven cook basically pointed outit is that under unless polynomial umthere is not effective polynomial n NPcomplete hierarchy an NP completeproblem and be problems class NPproblems are problems where if I giveyou a solution you can check it is asolution or not in kasnia time class Pis all problems that can be fully solvedin polynomial time MP requires somearticle to produce solutions in developand then you check if any of them aresolutions and if it takes any polynomialtime then it's ND so unless class NP isthe same as cos P Steven who proved thatboolean satisfiability is not in class Pand that started the whole structuralcomplexity theory is in fact it shouldcough then essentially went on to provethen he made a cottage industry andshowed every other interesting problemHamiltonian circuit oh it can be reducedto a boolean set can be registeredokay ah graphically power in certainareas to it or something else but inSeptember it is great if you keep sakeyou put it back to your problem yourdebt is producing that means it's ashard as the boolean set problem if youreduce your problemthat doesn't mean anything it just meansyou can solve the boolean satsanghis youcan use the boolean set some of us doyou understand website so that's thebasic you know which notes primalromantic ingredients okay so this isyour search and you can do it this wayand enter then the after the tree is thenumber of enables the causes only takepart this indirectly anytime a class isever violated in a branch should keepthe branch and then you can be go downright so it turns out that there bunchof other things that you can do toimprove this one of which is in additionto checking if your classes are alreadysatisfied or not you said if you'rechecking if a partial
