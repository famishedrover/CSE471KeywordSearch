no backpropagate you assume all theseweights are set in stone and you onlychange the first few layers of thingsthen you get to CID transfer runningHPCL your thinking is network day ittrying to make sense of gods and catsprobably will also work for other imagesmaybe you're wrong but the only way Ihave to figure this out is usingtransfer running somebody else whyscripts are basically trained on allthat we have those images from scratchand then gets better performance than meone advantage of doing transfer learningis you don't need as many examplesbecause you have much pure rage to learndo you see what I'm saying this is notactually medical research works right Imean instead of just poking you guysthey poke on the monkeys which are theresomewhere in the university after lotsand lots of monkeys have been torturedthen they figure out something and theytry to work on us so human x-rays arefew and far between they're not thatmean cap stocks mixes tons and tons ofthem so you train yourself attacksadvance assume how can exercise bedifferent from cats and dogs okay theAustrians add a few extra layers justchange those waves that's transparentokay the last thing since I got you uphere I will just basically walk youthrough thesejust one slide is the engineering partessentially that there are a bunch offancy terms basically you need to knowwhat is the size of the filter that'sthe kernel size you need to know thenhow do you move it in the moving averageyou need to move the windowyou know if you move on one pixel butstraight one you make 10 pixels that'sright yeah this is all elementaryultimately going on the amazing AI okayand then so they destroy a second isthat Patti okay so kind of a graphic isthe conversational kernel the mask thethe idea now is at the time of actuallythe Alex net which started this wholeconversation on neural networks beingthe state of the art they were usinglimit m---eleven condoms now basicallythe understanding engineeringunderstanding is the smaller likeanother word and you put really kernelsparlay but smaller that already okay thenext one is fatty this is putting thezeros just so that the image size won'tchange so that image size only changesin one place which is in the coolingrate and the third is the number offilters that is this maths problem howmany filters be Kodak you want okayremember you are going to get 625weights before now you are going backwith mine I'm sure you can have for acouple more filters like say threefilters 27 weights that's not too bad iswhat I'm saying you put more filters etcthat's just basically engineeringdecision okayand then of course this is you need tohave formula it's been a long time sincewe are any formulasbut the formula is if you have a w wherew an image and an f YF kernel and then ssubscribe that is yes except at a timeand be pictures of zero padding aroundusing all your finite mathematics thatyou know and up until seventh grade orsomething maybe for today you can showyourself that output size is oh by poorwhere is w minus M plus 2 P by s plusone looks like a fancy font well whatinvolves Commission so you should goback and tell your mom another divisiontoday if you stop depending on the slowreach uncle I am doing my own stuff okayand that's what basically yes okay so onAlex net example mid size was 237 by 237carnal side was 11 stride was threepanicvis 0 number of filters per layerwas 96 okay so the output size basicallyfor each other you know how Putin is canbe computed in a 55 and there would be55 slices one for each of the filtersone last thing which I want going toslowly by you should look at it which isthis computes the number of the amountof memory taken the number of parameterslearned for each one of these places inparticularly you know if you bring anested you need halves where we learnparameters if you doK of them you need K times F squarekilometers if you do a max pooling whereyou need zero parameters you will value0 that means that you do F see it's Mtimes and parameters so if you look atthis inAlex learned that number of beats beinglearned the total number of beats beinglearned actually hugely dominated by thelast layers every fully connected layerkills you and all the other layers aremuch smaller in number this is whypeople use parameter sharing then youexpect parameter shading you areexpecting locality in the image orexpectation function in the image thisis exactly what magic does when itexpects that there are relations betweenobjects there is faction in the world ifthere is no structure proposition magicis enough if the instruction we want topredict any objectsimilarly there is no structure fullyconnected networks are enough if thestructure you can exploit it by usingwith this Carnot idea which is justreally a specialization becauseeverything can metalloids can be not byfully connected Network okay this is oneother thing that I should show you Ihave this many events so you canincrease the amount of data for exampleif you are talking about images forexample you want this amount of databasically if you can either get emailyou know increase the data by justrecently taking pieces of the data ifyou know as what's-his-name's and roseby any name is rose I can't buy anycuttest in a cat okayI can't buy any slight occasionallystill a cat so if you think it is a catyour system should be able to say it's acatso one cat picture can be made into 200packages that's good job good job foryou because you agree there are there'sbinary this is if you won't go throughthis this part I'll show how to makethat let's say for example that I toldyou in the class it's being written herethe same idea is being done for deepdream the same ideasame idea even in deep bleep youessentially keep the network rates thesame I've been married to the networksee a few more things other than justthe object that it has in front of itand it turns out that for these notwatch most common apps currently ourtraining on image not database image netdatabases 1,000 classes a full 200 ofthem are dogsyes I'm sayingthis is why I said when you go to sleepyou don't particularly dream of dogs youbring off people unless you wanna getyour dog in kind of a person term unitbecause we have seen so we most of ourtime you're spending time looking atpeople's faces we dream of faces we makeup new faces for capulet's is too mucheasier to see dogs aggregate weather ifthis is for the people from India thenwe will you see any random thing it's ahalf people from here see mother Mary inthe sliced breadyou know you toast it mother will notyou say bow there's a dog it's what youwant to see and neural networks basicincome units train an image net can saydogs everywhere which is why a deepdream can get you to just like mass dogsand cats typically civilization advancesby ignoring small details and knowingconfidently that it can be done we haveis slow but first what the gradientdescent angle who will take care ofstock.we fetus priority and then thislast one this is lana buyer and she is aswedish model this was actually from aplayboy and then they cut it off andthey made this and so at one point oftime CBPR which is the annualfor a computer vision they asked her tobe the invited speaker oh my godeach of you spent give me like a centersomething once and dozen things whetheryou use my picture mostly this is thepicture that you would say in the wholeimage processing it is right I am now inbusiness which is as an academicbenchmark is 14 million images and 15really obviously became very famousbecause she spent time making the firstimage net it's not technicallychallenging but somebody has to sit downand make a benchmark and she was able todo it because there are enough picturesalready on the web if she tried to do itin 1960s she could have images so athing I want to tell you is how many ofyou say Bladerunner how so the originaleternal go back and see the originalBlade Runner now maybe this weekend okayyou would be amazed at how futuristicthe movie was right we were alwaysamazed but now when you see it try tosee the little details that you miss thefirst time aroundfor example lead Runner basically partTVs in 2049 will still be huge brickbricks and cell phones so the hugebigger bricks they had in taxes theycould think of that but they could thinkof TVs being essentially flat-screen TVsthey could think of you know cell phonesbecoming smaller and smaller the thingthat happens in science is people whoare working in a certain area try tothink of what's going to happenin the world at large expands in alldirections much of what happened forthis particular deep learning reallymost of this technology was right therein 1980s the thing that changed is everyone of you got a cell phone and startedtaking pictures of your taps and theirdogs then maybe your girlfriends theymay be your boyfriend's another world isfull of pictures point what did I allover the place so I think I mentionedthis to you that it's not like Unitedwasn't dragging people through theaisles before nobody was there to take apicture of it it wasn't that whitepolicemen were stopping AfricanAmericans for no good reason and givingthem more tickets than they were givingto white man nobody was there to takepictures now everybody has a picture Iam very worried somebody is taking apicture of me saying ah it's not funnybe positive so that is the level atwhich that data capture as inConnecticut are already introduced weare capturing it data capture possibleyou know it just happened because of thekindness of strangers the same thingwith GPUs the compute infrastructureincrease just by itself is not becausereading anything and it's useful tounderstand that while you're working ina Saturnalia sometimes hanging aroundand seeing what happens to the rest ofthe world try to make your problemeasier that you know that sound good
