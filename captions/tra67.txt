Gok by the way here is a veryinteresting thing this F of n equal to Gof M hmmwhat is the anybody who didn't realizethis make sure you realize this if youare at the cold mode the Kasbah optimalgood morning is zerounless you have major self-esteemproblems in which case you think i'ma gobut for you you are already in your skinand it's zero fast for you to stay inyour escapes anywhere else you have tospend by going this is your insane so Gup and boom mode will outwit each otherand for gaudium is 0 so f 1 is reallythe key events and I'm basically arguingI know that G of M is less than or equalto G of and double dash plus h of FDouble Dash we know this because that'swhat this is no as long as it took acouple - as long as each of intervalthere is less than or equal to thishandle - it started and our - issupposed to actually exactly thatdistance as long as it is actuallyvisible you are guaranteed andessentially what it's saying is by beingoptimistic about the distances you areguaranteed to be optimal when youfind the first North pasturephilosophical optimism and past givesyou optimal solution pessimism on pastmakes life easy it's like a givenexample it's extremely hard you're notgoing to be able to survive is fine wewill be able to do and their squad ofsurvival shadow don't see any moviesalready came and the action what a laserfull-on pessimism essentially iscomputationally great I mean at the riskof making fun and I know how to make funbut honestly depression is basically asearch when I start I thought of the interms of G values and a star mayor Ithought in terms of G as well as Hvalues as long as it is left and H thisis it this is as fine a politicallyadmissible in Star Search is guaranteedto be uprising now the rest of it wouldbe where do you get these kinds of Hvalues that are going to be admissiblethe thing that I did father legal rockwhere I wrote myself that's a bad way tolive lifeessentially you have no life on andgiving numbers to a researcher theyshould be an automatic okay so this isby the way the actual rules you knowwritten down so you can now let me showyou this to make sure that you get yournutrition about heuristics correctremember what I saidheuristic is for all and it's a functionover the rules even though we think interms of H of n it can be basically apartial course can you see what I'msaying so it's important to rememberthat you should see them as functions soyou need an extraction of x-axis arenodes and the y-axis is the heuristicvalue for economic and make up somefunctions okayand I've asked you some questionsinitiating with the accent okay that isH stuff but this problem first questionis there a corner for this problemassuming these are the research notes isthere a goal for this problem why didyou say thatthe others say I made this abilitiesback and I'm back I mean it was veryhard to make this each time like thatyou have the Spencer what is theaddition of obviously is it like this inwhich case it touches 0 hereThank You me fine what I can do thatok so instead I showed you which starand actually it corresponds to a problemwhich has no what you know either has itbeenlet me ask you some other questions it'snot there ok here is a heuristicthis is h1 is that invisiblefunctionality with h5 it's likepessimism all over the place so you arealways assuming that there are more butremember this if you tell your boss ohmy god everyone that the house gives youyou say oh my god is too much work toomuch what you have within work includingnot having a jobit's not okay okay so that's h4 that'sinadmissibleokay here in h2 is not admissible if Iget to use either edge to our h1 whichone would you use that's makes h2 moreinfoGUP admissible heuristic search to an h1h2 is more in farm than h1 is h2 isalways greater than or equal to h1 andyou see why this makes sense because ifyou wore a condom which are closer toeach star that means you take fewerexpansions more informative message[Music]obviously is the heuristic see what I'msayingmax will basically look like that it'sbasically taking the upper envelope ofboth attacks if you have to it makesproduced except one Rach till you takemax of X 1 X 2 that is know what theiraccommodations in terms of economicssimple idea but do remember that youhave to add them and so sometimes theremay be problems when you can come upwith Cherie speaks from throughdifferentlittle paints of abstraction that can beadded then you can make like much muchhappier but normally you ever take maxyes what's your book save a lot of moneythey both get the same exact optimalsolution one get some power but there isno such thing as automatic so one getsdone faster if that's pure consciencethat's it's in general all Swiftinformedness does guarantee she won'texpand since you see pretty sointerested let me skip over these thingsand show you this question trees andthen come back here is a problem it'sstar h1 h2 which is more infowhich is more info is h1 that's what wedefine that is the whole point of timeto answer Kiev question right so H 1 is1 in 5 h2 is messing form 100 you shallsay if you want to do search which onedo you think will actually do fewer moreexpansions each 100 how many peoplethink each one will do more fewer moreexpansions each one week which is moreinformed but it assumes everybody'sequalthus fewer note expansions how manyequal to h2 there is a reasonableargument as to why h2 is better rightbecause it's almost a mirror image itsdistinguishing between good guys and badguys almost the same way - okay so infact interestingly enough it turns outthat in phone message to force a measureif you are into this basically there's alot more you can do which is in terms ofyou need to be able to realize that h1actually is worse than X Foundationrecommends just like I just so nowhere's the interesting question why thathappenour estate actually do portal for moreinformation so our definition actuallydo more more expansions that is actuallyanswered here the basic idea and Istayed here at maybe to become cleareronce we go through two satellites is allthe nodes you expand the search okayremember if you have a graph uniform asearch was boring circularly likes insparse search does these are constant Gvalues constant distance well that's whythey're constantly in search constantvalue contours and the F value basicallytells you if your goal is this side yourfont decided not good it was G valuecontours will say everybody in the samedistance in test as well if we start touse that you tell you everything youknow enough and you have to be expandedbefore anything on the higher ed valuebut just the way a star works you seewhat I'm saying and in general thereason is your company look at in thispicture the reason a star is better thanuniform cross which is because it's moreand more directed towards progresstowards the goal and in fact for H equalto H star B star tools becomeessentially hairline parts of the lineparts of the path to the goal havingsaid that in the literacy questionremember I said every row morning um soif if the goal is at F star that meansthe optimal goal have that value fortheir star which obviously it will bejust isyou know but estar search will expandevery North whose f value is less thanfor sure that's how it gets we havestarted it would now expand it even asingle moon whose have value equal to Fstar until it expands all nodes whose Fvalue is less than F stuff it's the sameargument for uniform passage accepting gstar is tough stuff now in terms of theroutes that they started expands you cannow separate the number of routes itexpanded into all the nodes whose valueswere strictly less than a star which oneexpanded those are kind interior nodesand the nodes which are f equal we havestarted just because it known as Fequals to F star values of minutes agono over many non core nodes can come tothe same F star by adding some G M plush and where H is not actually zero yousee what I'm saying and in the X parttwo there are no guarantees that aninformed heuristic is guaranteed to getyour knows how the interior nodes forsure it's guaranteed but in some searchcompounds most of the work gets done inthat last content there's just too manynodes which all have the same F equal toF star value and there's only one or twoof them are actually goes and if you arenot able to distinguish good guys fromrecords which is what that media slabkind of heuristic was it will be stoppedoverand then it gets stuck on that whathappens in a star search if youunderstand this you really understandwhat's going on your answer if you donot understand this okay so weabstractions examples okayabstraction should be things like Sabhasimplifying the abstraction shape for apuzzle problem simplifying the movementokay and different ways ofsimplification can give you betterversus what seriously so for example letme just do this fast here is the highspot planning problem and particleabstractions for a stadium problem okayso here is the I which is the initialstate here in technology these arearbitrary avatar shape obstacles okayand I'm trying to find the shortest pathfrom I to G you know that is notstraight line because the obstaclesmight be intersecting you need to avoidthis is done by every mobile robotincluding rumba rumba actually doesn'tdo research what it does is it lets youand then moves backsurprise so room why is there anyactivity you know Baxter the robot goingon it's you know onyx waves back to thishuge we got a man like thing if itsfatherJade lyrics you your day so it needs toplan before acting it needs to figureout what the optimal path for whichdoesn't kill people before active and sothey have to solve this problem in theplane this stuff that I was trying tomove we're outside you get to this guywho's looking at the guise of naturalfood looking at his laptop most of thetime I could do that essentially theproblem is to remove all the obstaclesthat's an abstraction that's the one Iwas doing to get to that timeoh yeah that will give you straightendistance that's ABC okay just throw itinto the water give water to calmobstacles and essentially approximatelythem two circlesthese are inscribed circles if I findthe optimal path G in this that would befaster than ing here you see that sothis is a country that's faction okayalmost like it's an oxymoron like jumboshrimp kind of it it more concreteabstraction this is real abstractioneverything down here I agree sideso this some amount of obstacles arestill take me better a little moreconcrete abstraction is our obstacle onthe Left coming over I'm being toooptimisticso here the team if you're optimisticthis is like trying to do it Sam sayingit everything is easy it's going to zerocash back this will only work on eachother questions on they know somewhereafter the first questions first partthree hours are overif I give you the universe then youprobably wrote about but obviously sizemattersso Optima who walks about as toooptimistic means you never get down ifyou get the optimal solution but you arenot getting done in any given part okayso this guy is real this is the mostoptimistic so heuristic ask is cheapit's almost like H equal to 0 oq sickand this is to say IMG's obviously Idon't even have to take the state likethis everybody's mind right in whichhere that's really fantastic so that ishere is polygonal abstraction spawn apolygonal approximation to the obstaclethis is clearly remote until tabletsit's also take longer time to do thepath estimation gear but apartestimation here is actually going to behigher than the participation here weshould be higher than about excavationhere this is your informants if youunderstand this you understood bothworking partners means is that lookslike an abstraction[Music]do you understand what I just said thatwas my question why are we only inspiredme sparklesnot circumscribing circles the realreason is in English abstraction tendsto me not a simplified this looks likesimplified I put a like nice big circlearound you but it's not the technicalmeaning of abstraction technical meaningof abstraction is there are yourconstraints beside it what is a feasiblepath that means you're bringing yourconstraints to come to abstractionYoungstown what I'm saying so in fact inthis particular room I have assumed whatwill be after our abstracted everythingout is doctor is there I'm here with ablack hole here I cannot reach that sohuge big abstract everything you seewhat I'm sayingso remember that we are usingabstraction in the technical senseabstraction means movingand what happens when you areconstrained easily added at least a fewconstraints some parts like whatfeasible before are not that changesokay no problemyou understood this okay other problemthey're actually they're actually partabout particle mystics one is the numberof displaced five seriously right so theother problem idea essentially don'tlook at this right now the other formidea is not getting the back let's saythis is the current configuration andthis is what I want I just found thenumber of ties other than the blank thatare in the wrong place and that wouldgive the number of minimum number ofmoves the black has to be minimum yousee what I'm sayingokay now what why is something withamong counting the space fights and asplash because you're acting as if pilescan walk to each other and get to theirplaces so you're making move past themwhat feasible before which is you'rereducing the number of veteransthat's my number of displaced eyes is itbut it counts for example - which ishere and it's supposed to be here itturns on wrong space that's a valuewhich is here and it only needs to behere and also we just counted as onemisplaced but TV you might want to saythat it's not how far are you from youroriginal face right and so if I can walkto if I can still walk two blanks abouttwo miles then it's still the case thattrue requires more moves to get to itsreal place you can mine which only needsto go to places back so the question ofcourse is how do I measure this how manyspaces is supposed to how many moves isto suppose to me to get to it the otherways this is where the famous Manhattandistance comesit stated that anomaly could basicallyand go like this go like this answer itokaygalactic simulator right - it's realplace that means one to five fiveminutesthis way and also be finethe only thing I'm not allowing is somesort of shootand the only place that's not allowedis that stuck we have allowed isManhattan for those of you who mightshare in every US persons mine theybasically have streets and avenues andso it's a Greek word Manhattan is abreak is regularly she agreed and inManhattan you essentially to go from oneplace to other and you essentially haveto travel over streets and avenues wheredoes the energy breakdown for those ofyou who remember Manhattan how many ofyou need onerso when Adam has this thing on Broadwaythe thing about Broadway is it cuts tome it's one of the few roads that isactually not vertical or horizontalit's the Broadway that mimics thisanalogy border but otherwise Manhattanindividuals a Greek poet and thedistance in grid world is not thedepleting distance but actually theManhattan distance suppose instead ofall this nonsense about one happen I'dsay I've just used three registers
