anything buggydid anybody have an answer to thisquestion yes no just once I just knew it- that's a very good question so I'mbasically taking age and then giving youhmmfor different values of and already haveso for every place I'm just adding asmall random number making sure that itnever cooperate stuff so which actuallymakes for example at the goal road Ishould make sure that I'm only addingzero rightyou do see that because if I addanything other than zero then it becomesinadmissible and there goes on this isone of these other killer questionswhere you know I basically know Indianit has been suggested thinking exerciseyes your answer thenokay okayyes why would the adding a random numberhe/she it's not very clearanybody else yes whether it's not thesale okay you realize that for each noden I'm adding a different random numberright because for the know Turkish wantsto G I have to add amuse you but everynode I'm adding a different randomnumber which means we don't want anybodyelse yesso obviously tomorrow how many peopleteach it's - is more informed than agehow many people think it's a moreinformed on edge okay how many peoplethink it's not informed it's lessempower okay it's by definition it ismore informed damage because in everyplace it's greater or equal to H it'sguaranteed to be more informed otherwisethis is not even interesting question Iam giving you probably more inform yourestate and so you know my son used tohave this heuristic when I used to be ateacher then you're always tellingpeople around here so I will optionquestions and his is obviously theanswer cannot be the obvious one okay sohere it is I am giving you a moreinformative estate and I'm saying wouldyou use it like an estate and then butyou are given reason yes no open yourAlbany talks for somebody elseyes[Music]everybody everything it was just thelast thing you learn it's abouteverything that you're not good enoughokayso I wrote all of you expected thatbeautifully let me tell you the answerhas nothing to do with thatmaybe that thinking something else thatwe spoke about whether this was one ofthe very very exam questions I assume inexam oneokay somebody from the back rowssomebody who thinks they have an answeranyway yesokay let me ask you the followingquestion now okayjust raise your hands okay mommy can youread me so many of you raised in yourhands you know they strengthen membersso if you're stupider than everybodyelse each okay like raise your hands ifyou think somebody has awesome now raiseyour hands if you keep moralizing to begood to the Jews each - okay raise yourhands if you get a good idea to use it -terrible idea okay why do you think it'sa very good idea so I have this meansbecause they're notthat's my fusion aboutyes I'm going for the vegetable I'mgiving you now to figure out what theanswer is especially using IDs haI didn't spine missing so basically theworst case scenario would be the numberof iterations if an iterative deepeningsearch dozen as many iterations as thereare nodes then you stop doing theoperations is will record the iterationsavailable search does they do this yousee why he does this I am adding randomnumbers between 0 1 so they are realnumberswhat's the chance that two randomnumbers I think would be seen extremelylow which means everybody is each valueis going to be distinctly a number youadd that to G then everybody's F valuewould be a distinct real number themoment you have each other you will getdistinctly remember you are dead is youranswerthis is the worst thing that can happento IDs time because if the number ofpossible X values is as many as thenumber of nodes you are deadyes you just two IDs table ids one musicshop in church and you have this Fvalues anemic as well you waste kappa soyou start with F equal to zero and thenit increases the absolute then next itwe kissed value the node that has butnot in the previous iteration who theirfamily is closest to the current cutoffand slightly bigger than that and thenit opens the door that way every timeyou open the door you get one Nodinedidn't spend a lot of time talking aboutthose being opened only one person at atime coming it was all start with thatbeautiful car I don't have to ask aquestion from Vazquez I am asked aquestion from previous classes okay sothis is a useful thing to think aboutbut again that's soccer okay so yeah[Music]then this what happened everything in myquestion is important the random part isimportant telling you something this wasa historian question you're supposed toanswer under pressure for many questionsabout any questions that's how peopleactually got itthat's very much very easy the lastquestions harder to answer this but it'suseful to think about well I guessparking time how do you Dickie time okayokay so we're going to actually gameplease starting by the way theattendance code in there and I'm gonnaclose it very soon and now so anyway sothis one by the way the page that thething that we did last class right afterlast class it was open for 24 hourslooks like about 75% of the people fromthe language after people who want itand remember the only people who come toother ones who work in any election lastestimate is and and then there are 13people here so total that means peopleso this is like 24% lost so these guyswill be fineobviously I mean at least with the waythings are working out well but these Iwould say that if I go too much slowerthen it would be will not actually getenough time and so this is the reason weare recording everything so take downthe parts where you got lostgo back and[Music]and obviously I would love to take themon as students if they're surely reallytired was too slow and obvious and sothat means starting to be easy for themso please if you have a backstabberdocument and maybe we'll find somethingthat you can do it together okay butotherwise I was more worried thatthey'll be like more runtime unbalancedstuff but this is why okay so we will doour games yeah so basically we stillwere to do deterministic search okayso deep just think actually and so thekind of thing that we're doing is thereare two player games which basically youget to play against okay yeah normallycall the max on me okay for that reasonsand we can create them because thestrategy for solving the game would besomething called minimax strategy and sowe'll call them Max and min and you knowother thing is there are many manydifferent kinds of games that keep thisgame suck we are looking at two playerand typically we're also consideringzero-sum games zero-sum games means if Iwin you lose it is no such thing as bothof us losing and winning and you knowhaving a happy life you know if I benews so these are actually activelyadversarial environment so max typicallybasically assume that we are fightingthe strategy for max player okay andobviously people know what tic-tac-toeis right which will tell in differentdifferent ways basically these are darksunglasses or whatever so so max we'rebasically are is deciding what whereshould they put their transfer rightthat's the first name okay each playeronly gets to make one move and then waitfor the other player to make a movebefore they get a chance to make themagain right because in fact I can saythat the thing that makes get hard withopponents they're not pressing it donemuch husband okayimagine playing chess where there'snobody else in this crate okayultimately this one so in this case youare you could put classes in all thesedifferent places the question is you'reasking yourself which one should I doand the basic idea here is you simulatein your head if I want to do this let'ssay if I want to do that X there that Hthen basically my opponent so I do it sothis what they thought max that there'sa max later what means it is Max's turnto making them okay and by the way invarious places because basically try toput this for the max and this for themean okay that's like max wise to driveup the value min tries to bring down thevalue of the game and the reality of thegame is being seen from the Max'sperspective and so it's max wins that ismax here so that means when you areminus one it's a zero-sum game okay soanyway this isnice don't okay okay and then real makesits move it basically can make variousplaces where you can put the dock okayand then you have to ask yourselves okay[Music]then I will accept the places wherealready the cells are occupied sizedboardso after enough number of extra rows areput in a session you can't put any moreand in fact after times you might dieeven before that in fact the game mightbe over before that there are certainnotes in this scale that we callterminal nodes at the terminal nodeessentially means these are sure wings- max sure losses - max are sure grassyour honor on say the drought meansneither once means which means max meansmax no power loss means Maximus okay soin this particular case obviously if youremember if you remember of tic-tac-toeworksyou should not be surprised that this isa loss for max because zero is fromthree dots in a column so that's minusone okay and then in this caseessentially nobodyoh man I'd say and a trick here in themap is a deterministic world and itneeds to go to goal here it could eithergo this even goes this way go this way Iactually also call this rain in fact ifI go this wayand it's trying to figure out whichaction should be blue and the Venus onlyis basically cows a storage ask somesearch strategy which will tell you itwell the shortest path in peace and thenbasically in this the first action ofGod is going up so new task force -which is way down did you understandwhat I just said back to our simulationis supposedly doing it's killing ourparent our way all the way to the worldarm the optimal path to the goal so thatyou can then do the first action impactsis the reason you don't have an opponentand if the world is changing fast actionI mean what rather die does so we'redoing the same kind of idea except herethere is you and the mill youconsidering both the agentspossibilities okay now the question ofcourse is just as here in the singleagent the direction you're supposed togo finally came about after you have thefilter the optimal direction to go aboutafter you have a simple and whatever isthe full path first action was that'sthe first action you're supposed to beright so that's what we would do itessentially the question of course iswhat do I do with these numbers here andgo up okay that's the crux of theproblem let me discuss over this rightnow all right so this isno no this is the retailer to do itright nowand then why do you prove it okay so sobasically I have it like this right andI have some how to call the time rightnow I don't care about the time I takeso I took all the time when I made theentirety and then I know that values forother leaf nodes okayat that point I just need to figure outgiven these more values what should havebeen my choice that's the crux of theproblem you're trying to solve aresearcher there are also other issuessuch as mice you can even do the entiretree in fact for any game other thantic-tac-toe entire tree will be dead solet me talk about other things such asnot having to do directly but firstfigure out what you are supposed to dowhen you have the entire tree in frontof you and everything in the bottomwhich means nodes what are you supposedto do once you figure that out and onceyou figure out how to do that moreefficiently which is what's called alphabeta pruning so the first idea what todo when you have all the low and othernodes and what should be environment soour strategy and the path that idea isbasically the celebrated name backslashokayin fact the guy came up with in thatsearch is somebody who you heard upbecause you always found a computerarchitecture X computer likely to thestandards of your attention is calledone one I am an architecture one by onenow attach a computer any you know onvisioning is not in the engineer its butin a fall imagine a mathematician and heactually came up with I mean that suchhow many of you have seen a beautifulmind the movie there is a little scenewith one by one because John Nashessentially was felt always felt that hecould not compete with no one okay soone I'm not give up with he andMorgenstern came up with this ideacertain products properly it's not sucha hard idea actuallyRuby properties and more interesting soanywhere in a bottle that two thingsbefore I go forward actually not comeback to this in a minute but so I wantyou can sign up here I showed you a dealin with each node being an actual gameposition my lobster cassavetes thinkabout the game which one suddenlyeverything becomes I made myself a niceexample now I think this you snore Ialso allow for it doesn't have a minusone plus one other community numbersokay these these values this is prettygood okay with respect to it should become here right that will be fourteengood for youthat means the other guy didn't lose 14okay so at this point of how the treeright I have in front of me everythingthat I needed so the question is what isthe a one should do about what do youthink natural polity yeah but what ismuch more on it so basically what you'redoing is do I thinkthe action that will give you the bestvalue and what will give you the bestvalue you have to count from bottom upyou have to know what's that backwardinduction it's a pretty obvious idea sosomehow I could work from these 301 a Iasked myself watching this experiment soif this is 3 this is 1 this is H what isthis dead man what by 3 did you knowyour opponent did you know that opponentwill and always technique so it isimportant to know what you're doing herewhat you're doing is you have decidedthat your opponent would be fullybloodthirsty would be fully out to getyou and has as big a brain as you do letme be covering ok it's a fully rationalagent who is out to get youdo you understand what I'm saying okit's a good strategy to assume thatopponent will maximize their value justas you are maximizing your well okmaximizing value is basically amazing soyou wind up taking business of these 3and I'll get a clear similarly I mightupset the minimum these three already -here I'll take middle of these threeI'll get it to you right at this pointnow this will be taken up again and atthis point is that it will have to bewhatever is the value that's is maybethey'll take max will be 3 okay so thenthe value here is 3this is called the value of the game andhis wine from Max's perspective and thisis maximum value of the game essentiallyokay I'm it comes because it takes thisstep right it is take the step and weget the thing that's that so this is thecomputation that max will do and thenyou say okay I'll do a 1 okayat that point the game has when it hasdone one extra step now we if in factmean is also playing rationally and is acomputer able to use a v-max searchstrategy except they would beessentially looking for the mean ofthese learners you see what I'm sayingif and other if you are to use thequestion there is this we are playingchess playing alpha beta and sorrythis way of we play this game a dumbideayesso here's the deal suppose you'replaying with I think I mentioned this atsome point up and maybe already supposeyou're pleading with Garry Kasparovshould be you should do this and you'replaying with your crew the wrong withyou who can't tell the differencebetween the piece of candy and the justwood and you are taking about threehours for each you everybody will saywhat a loser by assuming that thistwo-year-old kid is perfectly rationalhow to get you a piranha you are wastingyour valuable resources that you couldhave used to do homework for his bodyand you have to decide what's theoptimal I want to find to spend on eachof these things you see what I'm sayingso this only makes sense if you assumethat the opponent is truly out to getyou you are my team only one Whitleywhich is nothing you see nothing elsematters you just want to maximize theprobability of not losing that myth maxis your way okay if there if you playwith Max on the full tree if you playwith Max on the full tree okay then youwill not ever lose the game is baby saywe have believed in you that's yourcompleteness so you know property justlike you know if you do a starter in theadmissible heuristic if there is anoptimal path you will find that onebuyer similarly is moving max andquickly you will never lose the gameanything definite okay now we're back tothis previous slide you see the give isconsidered solid it gave me sensor solidif we can be shown that the match playerhas a beaming are not losing strategyokay that's when the game is found it'sdifferent from being the world championI hope you understand this solving meanseven if people from ma who are worksupposedly much smarter than us come andclean you you can still not lose to themyeah we're not just looking from thematches perspective but this is anaccess perspective okay so that if agame is song that means computationallythere is really no point in playing thatgame how many of you play tic-tac-toeyou're all losers by caste attracttourists all
