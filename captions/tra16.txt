so like I said so we thought thepart-time example can you tell I wouldbe here anyway our next class but theywere mixed feelings discussion afterthat - so you know it's like a hugeamount of work for whatever reasonswould have that difference so what wouldhappen there of course is I just likeyou know I mean this was not if I haveto count the numbers because this is anactual short answer question I'll letyou know what happens and what we saidso even people who are not in the classhopefully and it would be at your nameI expect that people won't pay interestto you by Jegswhat is out there that everybody wouldsay yes[Music]could beyes yes okay any other questions yeahdid we did we talk about the um the waythat it would all be weighted and sportand okay sorry did we talk about if asecond midterm how would be weighed andyeah so I think it will be one way orother and we will basically look at itand it's not unless it is like oh wellmaybe one day we might decide to examand whatever so I actually think that'salso a good idea for business electionsafter the elections are over I thinkthat happens I think Israel has justtime are so many many years we have itout nobodyokay so what I'm going to do todaybasically turn fact is a model actuallycontinue doing that we started lastclass I change my mind I was going tojust do that with that piece and youwant to look like the in Star Search youare so in some interesting way is like anice connections that you can make andso that's what as I said our chapter 10is mostly what we will be covering I dothe part that you already done for themostgeneral idea is that in Star Searchrequired like in charge of mentalfunction and a poor test function andthen a search essentially basically isjust algebra class needed goal testneeded but then manage the queue itselfusing the F fabulous key values Hfunction which you can apply to any nodeand say how far are you from the goalokay the difference that we when we comeinto this what we are calling planninghere we have produced multiple differentplaces in this course to each other ifyou ever have an atomic model and you'redoing search and out has been calledplanning into reinforcement learningmodel means reinforcement learningessentially thus planning on the modelokay but that's basically research ok sothe same sir here is a star level we doit with operators we find in terms oftheir conditions and effects okay andit's a lot more natural way of thinkingabout actions so one of the interestingquestions would be if computers machinessome of the theories of cognitiveplanning a little bit and also generateplans you don't really care how theytalk about actions if on the other handlots and lots of events where you knowhow to actually solve the problems youknow what are the relevant actions andwhat you would wind up doing in thatcase is essentially write these actionsyourself writing actions is much simplerthan writing with child generatorfunction and and poor test function soif the actions are in the same formatformat they generally charge a vectorfunction and a generic old test functionand that can be used anytime the domainis in this one okay so it's like if weare writing in the operators a languagefor writing operators so that's what wewill be doing hereso that's what search means statevariable boxes and then we talked aboutin example essentially there are statevariables of our table I'm assuming makean assumption that people who left outbefore the extranet session actuallywatch what happened so we talked aboutthe stuff there that there are statevariables and the actions are written interms of the preconditions that must betrue and the effects that we will toafterwards and the preconditions as wellas effects are essentially what whatother no freaking should say certainstate variables must have certain valuesthese are not boolean state variables sothis one is saying to be able to pick upX Handan you must be true before and ifthat is the case then in the new statestate after the action it will make surethat holding X is true not on table X istrueand if this variable X is false andhanding these false and clear X is falseokay so this is some of you can almostmake sense of what that clear becomeactually is to you and this is how wecan take a new domain and write a domainmodel for that there's actually alanguage for this for writing this kindof thing that we do which is blurringso this is okay okay so so ittransitions like we said the actions aretransitioning states to other stage okaytalking about the physics as youunderstand it and so there are fouractions I can stack and and then I havean initial state where any sub payablemovies on table is clearly spirit andisn't the goal State I only handlenotice that in this particular menu is aand B are that fully plots only objectsthen you have clearly maybe you have amaybe you have on be a you have on atable you have unreachable you have onlyit only being you have had in ninedifferent propositions that can be trueor falsethis all ends I just nine differentproblems that can be true or false so itup neatly as you reach up these valuablea goal state basically tells you whatwhat are the variables that you careabout and what their value should andthere will be many many states wherethose variables have those values andall of them are constant words yes thisis more or less is what happens when youhave both test funny right so basicallyif we played with these two games a starsearch was seen as it because a graphsearch if the graph is natural or as astock nortec road as it well known okaybut really a star search was implementedas an implicit search when the graphdoesn't exist in front of you you onlyhave given the initial node which is theinitial state there is a child generatorfunction that you can ecology I'll tellyou what are the children understandwhat this function that says yes you'retough I know you're not yet now nobodyever told you that the goal testfunction will say yes only for one ofthe nodes it could have said yes to manymany nodes do you see what I'm saying infact optimal path essentially is tellingyou that there are multiple goals andanother one that you can reach with theshortest best actions right so ingeneral goal test function tells youwhat you care aboutI meant on anomalous for us about thefact that I just you may have yourcurrent initial state which is definedin terms of your company configurationin terms of the shore and the goal ispast the bus and it's not that I wouldhave here by the end of the time otherhere is not a variable when you okay Idon't care whether you have here ourmarket I don't care whether they have ashort commercial okay I only carewhether you passed outokay so goals are basically out of thispartially specified right and that'sjust an arm of the and it way thatbasically and then so a special case ofthis this is theoh yeah this is directly frompropositional logic because in essenceyou allow literals so preconditions canbe reversed effects can be labeled aliteral is a proposition or a negationof a proposition this what I'm saying inhistorically the original the fact thatyeah I kind of robotic revolution andSarah started with strips which isStanford Research Institute problemsolver and they have essentially thisyou know clumsy the waterplinky appropriate in the end and thatwould do things and it is in this flakyproject that has all bunch of ideas wereinvented in Star Search was invented aspart of the key project okayplanning like this okay and inparticular that particular problems overthat they used was on the scriptsproblem solver and strips has been usedfor a particular kind of search also asa kind of a language for piping actionsso the strip's language is this is thelanguage that I showed youso put down X has precondition holding Xso FX and recursion have networksstrips for video whatever reason decidedto for whatever reason decided to onlythink in terms of positive literals soit's if you're doing something usefulthat you are making something true okayand then so then basically it willassume that the preconditions are alwayspositive literals and effects are alsopositive it works and then the effectsare split into two subsets and deletethis at least basicallytake something then it says what if itis true just make it false switch is asyntactic distinction okay so in generalyou are more likely to theme equal toeverything sometimes in terms of add anddelete for actions you know what doesthis action made through what is theactual makefox it's not necessarily thecase that all bowls are positive when instrips they are in strips goals arealways positive preconditions are alwayspositiveokay don't destroy the world is a verynoble goal you see what I'm saying notthis pie the void is a very noble goalstrips won't allow you to see all rightthen you have to come up with a newproposition essentially I will notdestroy that one okay and then write itas a qualification in general you canoften vampire this representation ofthis representation in this because Imentioned fittingly have a language sothe language looks in this format I'mnot actually trying to teach you thesyntax what I'm just saying they willkeep you for any given domain they willthis is basically this command calledclipper domain there are two rules thereare some balls here and you want to getout of balls from one group to other andthen this robot has two Reapersokay so the optimal thing would be totake two balls at a time and moveinstead of taking one body retirementokay it's a very very simple domain andthen essentially there is some sort ofoptimization of the domainright in the state variables for thepain do you have an initial state andyou have a goal Stateso basically goal States is all theballs should be in room B that's whatit's saying okay and then it basicallydefines the actions of the same theprecondition and effect in fact they'reusing effect rather than actingokay what people actually also allowsinside actions this is just to say thatthere are is that you can write accessthis way and there are planners of themthat can beat these actions and generateplans for you see what I'm saying so buthow those planners what is what we arediscussing the same thing with neuralnetworks data tell us where you specifythe network without understandingwhatever the heck happens right and eachof this gets done and the differencebetween people who are using it up hereand you hopefully is you have some ideaof what actually gets done okay that'swhat we're going to do our planners willremain seated in this language where thedomains are written by humans so theyhave a sense of you know what what justlike you wrote your changes write afunction and Odessa okay and soobviously you can only write domainsfrom the point of view of the in thebeginning of the class you can onlywrite these kinds of domains in explicitknowledge domainsif it is tastic average you do it butyou don't even know how to do it youshould not be telling computer how to doit but the surprising thing as Imentioned at the time of the beginningof the class is there are enough Jesuswill you have explicit theories of howthe world works we have currently onlyeating about cats but which we have moretheories we don't know what makes againok but how do you for example send roveron the Mars how do you essentially tellit to pick for box before the Sun GoesDown do you think Matthew no after yousend over onto the mass it thenbasically does reinforcement learning[Music]right you know it's not like rememberfor a war there were the million peoplewho are losers who played go and thereare all these places for the same fordota they are not million people whoenter Mars there are no traces this isno data about what to do a mass youunderstand I'm saying but we have apretty good idea how to get things downand so you will essentially in fact oneof the example of a muchnessyou know NASA people when they talkabout planning mission planning is veryclose to this kind of take us somebodyactually knows what the actions are andit's just that still trying to puttogether plans even when you know theactuals in the middie hard that's whatyou read in a Star Search you know whatthe challenge is you know what a vortexfeel and yet it takes quite a long timeto actually come up with solutions ok sothat's the part so that's the reasoningpath so planning is reasoning ok so thisis how all the actions know coming theirpersonal small letters what you knowthen dislikes you canby the way you know right now if I'mright at one time it was the would befrom and just seems to get I know whatis a guy who invented this was JohnMcCarthy who was one of the four peoplewho essentially started the field of AIhe is the guy who gave it the name VIinstead of having it cybernetics therewas a pretty darn good name cause I wonentrance but he just hated now but whenI mentioned this to you and so he said Idon't want to have anything that willnot make now but when I start writingpapers for that so I'm telling somethingthat nobody in understand what kind ofartificially degrees and so biologicalcybernetics was actually what now whatwhen I was doing in fact a lot of neuralnetwork see research was done in youknow Soviet Union and published injournals like I won Magica they werelike okay okay so the message didn't askyou them til Schweiger not in the eyebase because either to the bomb languageokay but anyway so that's see thankshere is one other thing another exampleof this very small remainingjust one more idea so this one isactually one way off in the mainessentially I haveand two packages on earth and we want toget both the packages onto the moon andit's a one-way object and it's actuallya polar 30 so so the question of courseis how do you write it as a pantyproblem okay so you basically can thinkin terms of the state variables beingpackaged into earth package visa therocket is on earth okay and then yourgoal is that it is our movies our Moonand actually that's how you actually sayin fact I would even like this actuallyI might say that so I just basically thegoal is that the packages are okay nowthe interesting thing is how do you takeback from Earth to moon and the reason Ibrought this up is you can have you canhave effects of this in addition to justsaying you know after the actual Sunvariables will be true I can have anadditional effects it says get therocket go from Earth to moon it leavespure touching but if you are in themarket when it went then you're wrongagain earth and you young moon you knowhalf of the wonder what the cartoonswill be you know somewhat what's funny[Music]so essentially that they could get thePakistan to the moon is that you haveput them into the rocket and then if therocket takes up anything and to be ableto say that you write these additionaleffects which says but if anything iswhich is inside the rocket after therocket flies it will be on the moon andupon the earth this what I'm saying nowit turns out the condition effect is onemore of this way of writing things thatare in a more compact form you know youcould take an action like this which hascondition effect and writing do multipleactions which don't have condition levelso for example flight with just a onboard would be one action why did itjust be on board with the other actionfind it and be involved in the thirdaction why with nobody on board will bethe voltage and those four actions won'tintention effects you see what I'msaying so in some sense writing this youcan compile it down to those fouractions if you want but it's actuallyuseful to have these kinds of sharksright so you'll be able to write morecomplex effects okay so that's basicallyI want to talk about conditional airbaseokay so thanks a part of this farmbasically you write it as the effect butfrom actually immigrants a PQR and thisimplication fine is not logicalimplication it's just a shorthandnotation saying that if before it isdone in the state before it is done ispeacefulthen in the state after it is done shewon our will win itokay in addition you can have an actioncan have it as normal precondition so ifM is not truein that state before a a can't even liftup if the rocket doesn't have fewer itcan't even fly but you don't have to beon the rocket for you to file thisyou're insane so what is the conditionaleffect one is a feasibility conditionwithout sound okay so it's important tounderstand that this is about before aand and that's why it's not ideologicalimplication and so that's the languageand then in some sense I mentioned thatthinking of actions in this preconditioneffect farmer I'm thinking of wars interms of conditions that need to besatisfied have certain amount ofnaturalness compared to for example chargenerator function and more tests whichare opaque pieces of code you don'tnecessarily know when the voltage willchangeokay and similarly the other one in thecompression we know is atomic modelreward functions the adventures arequite general but when you talk about goand you talk about planning in life yousay I have to do this and this and thisso I have to four things before theyanother negative and I have there werefour points and if I do okay so thegoals will have some holy instructionsee what I'm saying so there are fourgoals and so you can work on each of thegoals in some harder until our goals areset and the other thing is when you areworking on a goal now money do what youwill do when you think of planning isthat you do what come that goal youprobably put in some action that wouldsay we get some I plan which requires meto go to the grocery store to buy thatplan right so these actions that have tobe put into my you know my ad chores nowsuch that those goals will be satisfiedright now if I want to have to go to thegrocery store then I might needbasically the action of going to theprocess to avoid involved a car whichExcel fight have three conditions suchas I have a cocky with me and the carhas store these are insane so he tryingto satisfy some ball you would put anaction which has its own preconditionswhich might have additional balls nowthis is how we tend to think of somekind of planning tasks that we do soit's not an alternate us only have thischaracter now is it the case that youfind us in the what functional map modelthe generator it is that if you areasking people give you the materialsthey're more like because this is how wenaturally think about plans and actionsso and again in the cheapest is so ifthere are empty ok so in the simplestcase if you have M boolean variables andpropositions then there are 2 power andcomplete States and for the simplestkind of landing problem which would bestatic that means unless you are doingactions nothing changes the definitionof an environment and full observabilitythat means you the agent can tell whatstate you are in that basically meansfor you you can tell being able to tellwhat state you are in each of these 2power n States you are and these 2 powerand States differ from each other interms of truth possibly values so coolobservability now becomes being able totell whether a state variable isproducts this is what I'm saying sosometimes after M state variables youmight be able to tell that you can sensethe true false key values of 50 notthere but not the N minus 1 you see whatI'm saying in which isthese of you have not blindokay in you know if you have this viewthen essentially the simplest case wouldbe initial Statespecified values of all the statevariables our own goal state only needsto tell you what state variables shouldhave what values so you may not careabout every state variable you know youjust physically now Treas guess we saidfor example that I want all the powersto be to be I did say that what shouldbe after the balls are moving[Music]okay right so that's the thing and somepost-its are partially specified andthen will be many word states whichsatisfy both conditions just like I saidthat okay but you are thinking what'salso being allowed in thisrepresentation and there is a naturalinterpretation sub-goals and supportedwhich is what I mentioned if there aredifferent features of the goalspecification if you want P 1 would be 2P 3 P 4 to be true in the whole statethen you can somehow say I have fourgoals now so one of the interestingquestions then becomes elect so when youare trying to work on 41 then you put inan action and its preconditions nowbecomes of course for you so yourecursively what kind of rules it's oneway it's one way of you know you thinkabout man so the other interestingquestion so there is so yeah so youbasically haveand this view basically makes you thinkin terms of support interactions whichis if you have five things to do it'seasy all those five things working onone doesn't take away any resources fromworking on the second right in that caseyou would say sub-goals are you debatingit's an abstraction most of the time thegoals that you have your life
