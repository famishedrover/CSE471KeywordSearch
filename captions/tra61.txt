so building leg with me might actuallytake long but you see is very fast andto some extent whipping it was avoidingmusic which means you want to avoid thetraps and what happens and what happensespecially because of the way I hope theevaluation function remember ifexcitable are not you take its truevalue otherwise you take this made-upvalue so as you're expanding the treeif you do see traps they improve thebacked up value significantly and thisactually happens pretty much across allinteresting games and people back whenpeople actually shown a that there arepathological means that you can makethey're going deeper worsens your chanceof meeting because it has known perhapsbecause it has no traps and withouttraps basically this thing is justadding noise to - see what I'm sayingand furthermore so the guy would besimply pathology in the guide ratherthan a mouse who was a mind he says comein here and then I got called oh sheused to be ever fresh because stillhangin around doing great workI mean II have here over the negativeword okay if I then even in ever get toabout actually I know in fact this issueof causation was a stagnation that Imentionedhe's pretty much the only guy who's beenspending in lifetime looking into whatis the best way of beginning of what iscausal was established in fact there isa book called the book of body it's youknow you know that's what you knowrequire and it's a beautiful book it'swhy I'm reading that okay but really youknow power is like that it's not a lotof work and heuristics then we have alot about on the game pleaseand in particular he showed that if youcan assume that there are traps that iswell distributed in the search spacethen you can prove that going deepernecessarily increases the quality by thesame time argumentmost people just is humanity what wehave and so maybe in truthfully I peopledon't think about this so it'sunfortunate for you that you have tothink about it because I'm telling youokay so much easier saying watch why doyou came you know it works because mostinteresting games have traps in tryingto live long and it'd be happy you haveto avoid getting run over by variousbugs and believe in you those areobvious perhaps that's exactly what willhappen to them say their world is fullof traps okay that's what makes youinterested so that's the deal with thisis the reason why deeper is better andif this is one of these photon calledhoney bunny deep ideas because mostpeople who are comingai most people who think they understandgame research don't understand andhere's one more thing I'll tell you whenwe get to it to become clearer when youdo MCT man talk about research thatdifferent semantics about research worksus this normal kind of depth link at theback search is magic about researchmakes it flow a single probe startingfrom max so I do this then that I'mgoing to do this then i do this then I'mgoing to do this that I believe thatapprentices and this until it reaches itever notice that it's just looking atone row it's a one randomized row okayand then simply teach that I tell mybody no it's a value and then it keepstrack of these and propagates theseterminal node values after my discussionabout min max as an evaluation functionassume that you are applying theevaluation function after these nodeswhich has no reason to be anymoreactually at the Knicks nodes as again Sat the upmost but the terminal nodesthat's their own truth so this problemnow back up for MC for that stillexplains that requires you to understandwhat I'm okay questions yesnever say that wanted it depends on howfar your movies which like both of youknow the same amount of informationabout the gamethese are perspective summation gamescharacters know anything more than youknow other than what they think okayTV perhaps that's what makes evaluationfunctions acquire it and leave peoplenot more effective it's like thestrangest thing the stuff that you'redoing at the fifteenth level just asthey trained as but on what you need atthe first level but it's these flapswhich will change the valuation becauseyou're taking you need some access yesthere if you have it in an opponent whokind of makes a pact with you thinkdon't worry watching I am the way I amI'm just going to really throw this gameimagine I'm unable to do one part thenyou just I won't even look there becauseI want to play there and you know stopnext you're rightbut it is the phonemes remember all ofthis is for now this is still in yourhead opponent still hasn't even madetheir book you are thinking publiclyschool you need to make these moves andI didn't make this movie this moves ofall the you know depth 50 moves in thecaptrick entry what does exit Italy tellme about the moves and I suppose and thebig guy is going to do exactly the samethingany other questionsthat's what we'll be talking aboutI mean time the move of the thinkingthat's not lightning chest right sobasically the time that you have seen isless which is the whole reason we talkedabout any type of computation so if youput out there when you move just byapplying evaluation function to the topthree knows you're not really such aboutit says that you'll lose more of it ifyou don't believe that row loses moregames you then he's feeling like inchess against other people who don'thave a life changes which is the namethis gave me right anything if you aswell as half power playing lightly chesswhat's the point you know this stuff Idon't know how many of your chest beepsso like the only way to answer there areso there were just people making anymoney make money like a mall orsomething they put huge number of bozoslike us you can prayOh thinking powers and then they justworking for the end of the day they willbe most of the games he the paths arethere will never be a next month becausenobody will play because the army gospelalways losing how that matches thelightning match okay and so in that yetyou do realize that them opponents don'thave our streets and you put actuallyyou lose but I will notice the beautifulread offs that games bring in to someextent they bring in the fact that thatis only one o'clock when you arethinking and when you're doing powers inpower and that's basically what are myconsciousness okayso this whole thing I actually discussall of this the whole idea kind of stepoff searches they're found onlinesearches it's also to making decisionsduring the time when you have to makethat decision without having seen allthe way to the end and online searchesunlike a star search which figures outthe optimal full solution and makes thefirst move other solution so you canhave a be gone online searches can bewrong in fact there is this wholequestion of I'm going certainly not onlynot guaranteed to be optimal in terms ofthe number of moves taken to win thegame let's say it's not even guaranteedto be complete it's not even guaranteedif accompanied because why because thisis a beautiful word that I'll throw atyou and you should use this to impressall these other people who will come tothe class vorticity and why does he saythat and then look very meaningfulwhat is a courtesywho knows what is a 30-hour garlic oilis the fancy name for a world where youwill die even if you squirrel the whatis wrong with death unless you believein some happiness jams where that isjust one more step and then you'llcontinue reading that is a great top dogyou go in search spaces can have one waytrapdoors you can basically get to thisnode because lots and lots of nodes youhave this stage as a child if you searchyou can you ask the poor guys where oncea mile get run over by carsand they think they are just onlytalking on the cell phone whilebicycling these are all manicotti notesso in particular after that definitionof a vorticity is given any period ofstates in the world there is nonzeroprobability of going from one state tothe other state anyway of shapesbeautiful definition is that it givesthat death state cannot exist becausethat state to any other state is onlyone matter there is no operator innarcotic the base my search is not evencomplete word is not a bodyyou may still have to do online searchand swap quietly my buddy buddyso you notice how give sort of open upthe Empire you are nice and happythinking deterministic static worldnothing is going on and then you startedon everything okay actually not thegoodness boom but again this is natureokay before I go forward let me ask youthe following questionif you don't know which people you'regoing to play I decided some person youget to play our nature we can dovariance and I decide the game which isa better dealhow many people think playing gamesagainst person is there how many peoplethink playing games against nature isbetter that guy is the only smarterthey decided for nature ma'am there areat most asteroids will hit and what isthe chance of a huge big that star asfor her to find its way do I want you tothat place extremely low but have somefun with bucks apiece we made one pointzero problem do you understand what I'msaying in fact it's a beautifulstatement that you want to rememberevolutionarily we have to pick every Iunderstand most of the times aredepressed saying how my brain is so punyokay to other people people are badcomparable talks in effects huge bigelephants the office this compared toall of them our brain size to our bodysize is ridiculously high most of ourenergy consumption is to keep our brainup that was never a problem for dancersthis huge because the tiny little birdbrainusually by eating humans have such hugewings easy to bother it from the Lionsof Savannah Tigers afraid of no witheach other your biggest enemy is otherpeople take a sprain these other peopleyour biggest enemy is other people soit's your chance of playing againstnature causes people take nature youknow why nature is indifferent to you inspite all your religious upbringingwhich might think that if you do rightnumber of players nature will startworking for you that's all comedy Naturedoesn't even care that you exist it willdo what it doesso here is my point suppose I'm here sosuppose I have my max guy there arethree nodes these three things thathappen for me and if I'm playing in thisnature and I computed some probabilitythat's for how up with these things arehappening the minor form of this ishappening point 1 percent of the time soI assume that even if you are playingwhich it will still basically roll inthree sided coin and decide what willhappen it's not going to say oh I alwaysthink let's get himobviously love is God sound let's helpno such wrong is just one word boss andI have my knuckles I justyou see what I'm saying we get us theseprobabilities are useless if you'replaying with a human in fact you justloop it what humans have between orwatch our time and come up with thesenumbers and then you are playing again astatue month they may still decide to be- there with one point zero probabilityof a given C because they know thattheir training is there's no one thatthey don't like you know that they wantto live they want you to lose soprobabilities will be thrown out thewindow and you take mean which is whytaking him when you obtain a game a gameis the nature he's paranoid this is nosuch thing as being paranoid with peoplewhatever Padma you have there was neverthere to be universe things for you thisnature if you are essentially assumingbasically even though these propertiesare there you think that's for normalpeopleI am such an unlikely person - and willhappen to me you being paranoid okayand most of us like this is point 5 / 7etc but let's say for example theseformats age 13 then I'll say this one isbusterI say that the good thing will happen tome the spectre what is properly then I'mbeing delusionalyou can be delusional you can make -enough which is realize that these areprobabilities these three things willhappen and what you can expect isexpected return which is probability xvalue plus probability timesplus prominently placed and that's theexpectation left mr. Lamson that's whatyou do when you are in nature and hereis a gimmick in this nature inparticular gives a Guinness nation wallstep a species that means you do a stepit may not necessarily have a singleoutcome it might have multiple differentoutcomes with different probabilities sonow this nature are now I'm going backto this simple game when you're playingagainst nature you essentially assumethat your cigarette is against thedefendantso this is hit report right and I'm herethis is a mini batch field if I everbullied I will never come out and I'llget a huge amount of positive return butthat's it you'll never get out of iteverywhere else as you go through thenotes you have to go through the stateswill be legal books still have you stilland how those negative rewards - zeropoint zero let's say this particularproblem I just assume that it's minuszero point zero okay terminal and thenyou can take that too so if you comeback to that state will get homework Ohstill see here one more is 0-1but here you can only go in once you cancome out okay now I'm here I'm trying tofigure out a sequence of actionsme for my actors if this is somegeneralization about planning for somenext class will realize that what we arelooking at here is motivation processwhich doctrine which basically sogeneral that it has many manyspecializations one of which isstochastic shortest path oh okay imagineyou just trying to somehow get to thelast one as fast as you can so you willdie with a smug happy case yeah thequestion that we is what's the solutionrace this is a stock set except for thisnew take in particular if somebody sayshere is the sequence of actions you aresupposed to do here is the sequence ofactions you are supposed to do then youshould tell them because give you thereason I cannot attend one importanthuge change the thing that makes it'sfantastic is the actions both havedeterministic effects so here is a goingof effect going up action so wheneveryou understand you can go up go left goright go down and it's possible in anormal deterministic search you will goup you go up to the next one that'sabout to go down you go through the cell1 0 right what I'm going to do is I'mgoing to say there are probably isinvolved it's a cheap robot and it triesto go up eight point eight probabilityto actually pass for with quite oneprobability it was left white one commonecocide it's not as cheap as yourfriends robot which also probably goespoint seven point one point one pointone that he is also going backwardssometimes when itthis is the circus to see because thereis fantastic City if I tell you there isa sequence that's the optimum solutionto this problem we should lock it rightbecause if I say yeah obvious want to goto pass on them wha oh right right waitI think they written what's wrong withthat because then I said whoa ah I tryto do half I might actually go upI'm good I'll go that which meansactually will be in the same so thesolution for this problem is not asequence of actions in fact the solutionhas to say if you are in a particularstage what should be your move that'swhat's correct policy the solution forthis problem would be a policy whichwould sort of look like this maybe havefor example here is a policythat wasdo you guys see this with no new policyI can do a back policy if you want makeit okay for example I will in stop thisthat's a good that's when you die veryfast something here instead of this Iput it like thisthat's another policy it's a bad policyso you see whether you're good first ofall you start looking for paths they'relooking in terms of policies plus youcan talk about good works of badpolicies this just opens up wide openthe one idea of what it is that AJdespite despite the computer policy lambon a sequence of actions is a specialage that makes sense then you havemetastasis and accept that we will talkabout it in significant depth next classI'm sure if you started reading 70 wesaw up in the chapter 17 usually howthis should be making sense it's justthe way I came from a bridge to this youmay not have seen but you know you canmake sense of this but then I have thesepolicies these policies are a few ways Icould have solve this problem one is Icould just give you an outlinecomplication of them there that gives mea policy that is probably acting justlike a Star Search said the policy saidI will just write an algorithm whichgoes behind the doorswatch watch works I'm sorry it says hereis your policy okayand when you've thought about people carseats then we'll never have to askyourself what should I doeven though you're playing against thenature do you know what to do in eachstate because you computed that nowpolicy effort that's offline computationhalf once that's what you startedreading in chapter 17 and there areapproaches the staminainnovation and policy iteration talkabout them in become but today I wantyou to think up a quotation processes interms of online incarnation it's reallya game and computing the entire policyis too costly many other I just want toknow what should I do now and I do itsee where I get then ask muttering youyou are Samsonthis will be just like playing in amystic a plane except this player isnatureso whatever to win but becauseexpectation agree okay so this is how itlooks the same idea online solutions forpopulation processes this is a creationprocess begin as a change right so hereis the vehicles are lexically - wherethe heck people is so I mean we do whichin here ok and I can roll left down allright if I go left if I go left fromhere there is you know B I will get 2for 2 with point 8 probability I get 2is not with point 1 community which isgoing left of the direction of minus 1now let's try to go to right with oneone problem and the expectation in thesegames is that in this kind of an exampleis that when you try to go in adirection and there is a ball you stayin that there is no wayokay so those are the three things thatcan happen to you so if you put out one- four - okay ahthree three three one by the way we doactually is not this at all and fromthree do is to do pull left you go 2-1whoa up straight so you have a littlebox and you still alive - point zerofour point okayand you should call this side under 4-0okay so now we can talk about what arethese values for this these are emptynotes the values that I am giving thatthe immediate rewards okay but I if Idon't have any better idea I just takeimmediately what of the state and saythat's the evaluation function if I havecut away and then I computed some otherevaluation either which way I canbasically if I have these numbers here Ican do back up to compute the values ofeach of these moves as far as the heightof organisms in this part is amazingexpectation and see which out is thevalue that suggests that's the note thatthis is equal to one flying game treeand to play such which is I do whatnature does one step if you want to domore together you can make this tree upto here like five or six levels deepapply the immediate reports at thebottom and it came back as you'rebacking up you'll notice that all theintermediate nodes will wind up gettingbetter and better values which isdifferent from the evaluation functionvalues so if you are smart and if youhave ahash table lying about unused youremember these are the graduation moneyif you did this you doing something likewhat a fabulous it's computing thevalues of the grid so a question ofcourse I already said these are here youknow here are basically makingexpectations that's what I would do if Iam a nationalist or I realize thatnature is of previous of my existencefrom the other hand you think you're thechosen oneyou think nature does the stuff thatwill benefit you and it's not right andif you have that might one use I am theloser religion will do the thingmaximally gamma DT if you have asatellite but you still be alright rightand if you are wrong that we just had asatellitenobody is out to get what you justassume they have ticket okay so this youdobasically this so this would be Bill Maxand you do min max if you in fact know
