as I said on the exam based on the pollthat we had we're going to have inextended sessions from 245 to 350 you'renot required to be there I understand70% of you said you wanted 30% of yousaid that you actually have conflicts Icompletely understand that people mighthave conflicts and they also leave at2:45 so what would happen of course iseverything is being recorded these twowill be recorded let's just assume thatthis part is a required watching for thenext class which I'm allowed to do okayI can't make you stay here when you haveconflict I don't want to but on theother hand since not people areinterested then because to do it thisway this part so as such any just haveto make sure that the last 30 minutes ofthe class if you have to leave youshould see me when you leave any witnessthat is fine too but you know and yousuddenly should feel free to leave at2:45 I know some of you actually haveclasses and stuff but I would becontinuing until 3:15 and then that last30 minutes basically you should make upby watching it before coming to the nextquest that should be too hard that waythen we will all be on the same samepage that we go to this class okay okayso and then I need to send this thislarge chapters a second a lot chapterone chapter of in Goodfellow that againgood fellow wrote for the intro periodictextbook I'm assuming that elaborate andI read itbecause much of this stuff and more isthere in some sense actually part ofwhat you guys what it for essentially isI will spend this week also are deeplearning which means that chapter it isquite all right I will still cover thefuturebut I shower more of the chapters thanever gets our America in fact as I saidmost of the nuclei classes will have atmost one lecture our multi-layer neuralnetworks and so they able to do moreobviously okay so I'm assuming thatyou're reading that that's where all thereadings are coming from these are notgiving any separate readings but youknow sometimes I have given life examplelast time I gave some examples for thetwo sites actually one of whichSiddhartha's excruciating detail how todo the backdrop calculations the otherone which shows how essentially on thecomputational graph backward propagationis basically automatic okay the textbookchapters are in two fellows chapters arementions it but doesn't spend as muchtime going into the specifics but it'swhat one understanding in particularthat second part that so I put thistoday for a reasoncivilization advances by extending thenumber of important operations which wecan perform without thinking of themeverything that you take for granted waslike new and shiny thing at some pointof time in human civilization and theywould actually make a huge deal about itat that point of our know any of youknow this but when electricity whenevery bounce or alleged people who arelike so crazy that you know on you areFifth Avenue people will have lights ontheir heads and walking around you knowyou do it to summit sometimes whenyou're slightly drunk earring in theconcerts but normally not okay it'sbecomes like a haunting we take them forgrantedokay so similarly in fact one of thethings that you almost have to take forgranted is backpropagation the fact thatif you define a network then the forwardand the backpass on the network can be essentiallyautomatically done by some higher levelprogramming language that's what yourtimes up close except I do okay and onceyou realize that you spent a lot of timetrying to get to this point you knowtrying to figure out that backpropagation is nothing but chain ruleand that it can be done that separatesapply because once you figure this outthen you put this as computer scientistswe know how to put one less amount ofjunk into one subroutine and justbecause a protein car okay once we knowthat this get way down you will seeactually as we go forward that we startplaying basically we start assuming thatanything can be made a parameter I'm anetwork and the trustee or the gradientdescent will learn it forever just likeit takes forever to build a coral reefit might take many many a course but itis not everything in fact one of thethings that we talk about today is patchnow which is essentially how toinitialize ways how to kind of Reenaharmonize weights in the neural networkand we notice that we will that we aregonna be a learning problem so you aredoing a novel learning as well aslearning how to analyze the inputs thatare coming in to different layers it'slike a drunk on this crazy power thatyou can call the gradient descent andyou just get up you know it's not yourproblem anymoreit's your problem still in this classbecause you need to know how hackeroperation watts but from now onwardswill assume that you sorta got thisunderlying confidence that if we gettaken care of so that we can build morethings on top of it that's exactly whatAlfred might have you say if you alwayshave to think of differentiation bygoing back to limit H tends to 0 FX plush minus FX by age then you willbasically never go anywhere you have tounderstand it once but then you have tobe done ah ok yes please what I alreadyanswered o op C that's I think that'sthe reason why I stopped evil most oftimeI have a very good predictor I have a2-0 record so that's that and by the wayfoundokay so we'll move forward on this so ifyou a quick review after this last timewe saw a month earlier because I quotethings like this this is like theobvious the simple architecture thereare other kinds of objections you heardof we will at least talk about oneadditional architecture of combinationalnetwork because you know you kind ofbasically know about it and but you knowthese are basically considered fullyconnected networks so every node isconnected to every other node in theforward direction so these are themulti-layer networks you can we saw themulti-layer networks we saw how backpropagation works in principle you wantto really think of multi-layer networksas this part plus this part this willalways be logistic perceptron if youhave doing classifications okay so whatis happening between the image layer andthis layer is the inputs are somehowbeing converted your inference space wewould be in fact your perceptron and youknow that that's a kinetic will haveinvention because perceptron can only dolinear separation but you know that ifyou convert the initial inputs you knowin arbitrary ways for example you say X1 X 2 X 1 square kind of changes whenyou do that they become obviouslylinearly separable so you can imaginethat whenever you see a linear neuralnetwork in most cases for our purposesthe last layer is just a logisticperceptron and the guys before that aremassaging the input in a way thatlogistic possiblehey I'm going blind do you see what I'msaying that's itand in fact it's useful to understandthat because when we get to continentswe will physically decrease this we keepthis the same but we will replace thisinto a completely different architecturea convolutional architecture whichessentially does its own different wayof extracting the features from theyouthful innocence okay and then whatthe last layer is still linear perceptlogistic per second yes okay so that'swhat part and then so with basically youcan think of the multi-layer nets as abunch of players extracting featuresfrom the input with the last layer beingthe logistic perceptron always okay andthen we saw how back propagation can beactivated in terms of the backward classon the computational graph this isreally the biggest contribution ofcomputer science but this earlier aprogramming practice all day okaybecause the moment you did this all hellbreaks loose now basically people canwrite Mundus lee large networks and sayit's not my problemthe machine will take care of it do youunderstand what I'm saying and it opensup humongous amounts of flexibilityhouse of opens up lots and lots ofproblems in fact this is very beautifulthink Patrick Winston is as a guy whowas not Marvin Minsky's first generationof students he actually passed awayrecently he's a very gifted teacher okayI had MIT and he did some of the earlywork in the eye and one time when hegave this talk at 1999 Shipley I he madethis very interesting analogy that stillsticks in my mind that other engineeringsiblings have upper bounds on what theycan construct because of the naturallimitations of the materials that theywork with do you understand what I'msayingI see that we have high high high risesyou know but you really don't expecttowers that will be three hundred fiftyfive stories tall there is no materialin the world that can support that kindof a structure so in some sense thematerial limitations put some disciplineinto the discipline or the disciplineinto that areacomputer find this more such bodies doyou see what I'm sayingyou can write any number of lines ofprogram now have the past in the pastyou won't write big lines of programit's painful to write a program then wekept in written all these high-levelmetaphors you would write two lines ofcode which becomes a million lines ofassembly code right are you right toline somebody out sighs two lines thenwe copy them together and make a biggercone and that becomes even bigger andwhat we are doing right now essentiallyis a natural progression of that wherewe just described the network in thisinterfere of sort of an implicit fashionit can have humongous number oftrainable waves and essentially thisentire structure is going to be learntdo you see what I'm saying so thelimitations are much fewer in computerscience because we take abstraction forgranted okay and that's exactly whatAlfred Wojtek not was talking about weare now abstracting the whole entireidea of breed back propagation on anyrandom network you just know that it canbe automated so that now you can startif I give you this party liability whatcan you use it for what are all thethings else you can do that's what we'regoing to be talking about in the nextcouple classes okay so in general of thedecent backpropagation think what'sreally the automation of thebackpropagation think what's really isthat after work is just a huge functioncomposed of are the functions andradiant computation involves using thechain rule which can be done as thebackward pass so you define your highlevel network architecture I have youknow in some language and then theunderlying software makes it both thecode for the forward pass and the codefor the backward pass and then you gohave a cup of coffee right okay that'sbasically what's going to happen that'sphysically what's the exact and softwareetcetera can generate backward power busis pretty much automatically once youspecify the architecture of the networkwhich has reduced the amount of timepeople take that the barrier of entryhas been reduced so everybody can saywith our machine learners we are in deeplearners because we know how to switchon the computer and then it stuffhappensokay so now we want to figure out howactually these stuff works more of howoften the stuff works in particular westart about read a dissent it makesthese little points and then you'll stopat some bottom line you have to stop itsupport after they induce now the lasttime around when we talked about valueiteration we said it will make valueiteration updates have data objects wehave a soccer supporter when you stop wehad an idea that we connected hecompared the value vector from the cavehydration to the value actor- one titration you took the differencevector you put the maximum of thedifference vector what is the maximum ofa vector it's basically the coefficientthat has the highest valiumokay and you said that should be lessthan the absolute value of that shouldbe less than or equal to epsilon whichis a threshold that you made up and whenthat happens you say I will stop thatwas your termination criteria I want toknow what is the termination criterionfor ready descent in now the interestingthing is that we can be taniyama quotesin this strange way just so that becausewe want to hear about it as soon as youcan rightbut neural networks and you know deeplearning etc are part of machinery ingeneral there's a huge amount of theoryof how to do machine learning and muchof the first part of today's class wouldhave to draw some of the background andmachine learning itself that machineryproblem itself and then see how itconnects to the machine learning in thecontext of neural networks as the formof the function that you're learningwill at some point of time during thiscourse look at other kinds of functionsthat you could have learnt such as adecision tree which doesn't look at alllike an Euler network and we can alsolearn a belizean network which is aprobability distribution that also isnot your own network it actually mean solike a neural network but it's not inyour network okay we look at thosethings too from all of them as well asthe neural networks there is this commonidea of machine are you needgeneralization in machine learning andwhat are the requirements and we startedtalking about this at the time when weshifted from reinforcement learning intolifted reinforcement I remember thecompression was such generalizationdiscussion bias-variance tradeoff wewill revisit them today and we will getyour intuitions about what should andshould not be they can be consideredand you say you're solving ageneralization part okay and then thatwill get corrected will answer them tothe question on offer where do I startbabysit it also answers whole bunch ofother questions such as how big shouldmy network be how long should I run itall these okay so in particular of theanswer is these two clients what is thegoal of generalization learning what doyou mean when you say I am trying togeneralize you can of course overgeneralize you can also under generalizewhat exactly is a formal way of definingwhat is it could learn supposed to dookaywe need to understand that and then ofcourse the second question we constantis how do we even evaluategeneralization learning as we talkedabout that keep in the back of your headthat when you take tests in any classincluding my class you are trainingyourself are some problems and you'rebeing tested and some problems you wouldlike the problems that will come in theexam to have been sent to you the nightbefore so that you can memorize themmaybe write it on the cheat sheet sothat you can quickly write it onto theexam sheet but that's not consideredlearning right so you do know that theexact test questions if it's differentfrom the ones that weren't given beforeand you have a sense of what is it's atest versus what is an unfair test youare going to be using those intuitionswhile we are talking about formaldefinitions because in fact they arewelcomeokay so first question is what isgeneralization trying to accomplishlet's look at this imagine so youconsider any classification problem okayany classification problem you couldhave considered is it a cat or not Iwill make to make my life simple I willconsider binary classification is it acat or not or is it a fraudulent creditcard transaction or not okay so let'sjust think in terms of a fornicatorsections for now so the idea is imaginethere's a huge big bucket of allpossible credit card transactions okaythis is huge we pocket and then I takesome number of transactions from thisbucket sample then pick them up do somewebsite he says we are pick them up isconstantly this is all basically thebasis of learning these statistics soultimately we'll have to talk aboutthings like step sampling anddistribution okay so I'm going to samplethese credit card transactions some ofthem I'll pick up and then I give them asay that's the training set and for thistraining set for this training set Iwill also tell you whether the traffican exactly started it or not you seewhat I'm saying so the transactions aredescribed in terms of some features x1to xn and a la last feature of Y whichis it Prada you see what I'm sayingand I picked the home of thetransactions and and then for the onesthat I picked I put as a training setI also told you what whether or notthey're foreign transactions so I gaveyou this as the label right now rememberthat when I'm giving the label now youassume that the teachers know everythingbut teachers make mistakes okay so Iwould have been labeling themincorrectly sometimes I could have beenlabeling them incorrectly okay sohopefully I mostly correctly child laborthe transactions but they may have beena few false positives and a few falsenegatives a false positive will be atransaction that is actually notfraudulent but you say it is first atransaction it happened to me yesterdayyou know I transferred a bunch of moneyfromand my bag she is basically cancel thetransaction said maybe cancel thetransaction because it looks suspiciousand you have to call this number so Igot this and then basically I try to getinto my account my company's lot becauseit's fraudulentyou know it was categories of moneywhich is probably true my I definitelybelieve that by but the point of courseis that the account was closed so Icalled the number the usual thing thishappens every once in a while it happensif you actually have that cross therewould be further transactions they willtell you they put you know they block 30and they're coming so it's like on themand I talked to this guy for a long timeand basically like I said yeah soundgood and I gave all the evidence I saidokay now you go down to a real ChaseBank with two pieces of youridentification so that they can kind oftouch and feel you and make sure thatyou have the roughness you that was mebeing false positive it was damnedinconvenient I don't want to lose moneybut yet if I was somewhere in India andI'm gonna travel I have to come to ChaseBank it to be able to you know show thisto them but so false positives havepassed right but anyway so trainingexample they made a false positivesimilarly we have been a false innegative it may actually have been afraudulent transaction that they didn'tdescribe as a front Delta then you labelas a father transaction yes I rememberto have zero noise well if in fact youhave ID a teacher and the teacher knowswhat they're doingyes if you have a go through teachersometimes and mistakes are actually theright thingsyou see what I'm saying okay so if yourteacher knows what that usually say yesif they don't make any noiseokay so this is the training set in somedistrict so the B if I said I put myhand picked up I put my hand picked upright really the way you formalize thismathematically is that there is aprobabilistic distribution over thesetransactions and you get this sample adistribution you can sample adistribution so when we sample adistribution the things which havehigher probability will get sampled moreoften the things which are lowerRobert Deluce it gets up for less do yousee what I'm saying so I sample themwith proper distribution P and then Iput them in you know in this place herecalled the rating set from here then Ihave a learner gets a sum then itbasically what it tried to do is come upwith a function some hypothesis whichtries to fit to these training examplessuch that that action tells you if yougive the description of that any examplethen in tell you whether or not it is itis its class and this function is suchthat it makes a least amount of error onthe training set okayand so it basically winds up sort ofpredicting the training set at least asclose to what the training set size ofthe labels as possible and at this pointthen you are going to test this learneron a test set and a test now maybe thedecepticon it can't promise a waywith some distribution P - we got somemore transactions on the bucketphysically to the learner actually haveit worried try preparing their ballotthen you are actually testing thenetwork even for this particular that'sit you happen to know that true labelsso you know what is called it thatground truth when the network where thelearner is being used in the wild nobodyknows what to come to these thecommunity is what the record says thecompany's so before you put it into thewide you want to make sure that it isdoing something right according to yourtesting right that's what you do so theinteresting thing you notice is I pickedup the trainees these things are withsome distribution P from this bepocketed and then I picked a test datawith some other distribution P - from asa big bucket and then I'll essentiallysee how many of them has it correctlyhas it correctly labeled what was Sundaythat the calcaneal so the accuracy wouldbe the percentage of the samplesincorrectly labeled and it's because youhappen to know the wrong way okay sothat brings us to the question what is afair test set what is a fairness easilytested as good as any other s set andwhat is a fair test you realize that Icould do this irrespective of how I gotthe test which can I just pick up someno Hardy so we should be - and then youstart to sample the data and thenpresent it to my learner I happen toalso know their levels an end okay sobefore we give some formal definitionlet's look at this this was the testfrom the classthat you anonymously voted as two onthis particular poll and the questionfor second thought my questionsbasically in the forward which of thisis what you believe examples fail I didwell exam was fair but I struggle examwas unfair but I did outright exam wasunfair but I did badly blah blah blahyou did this you know it was a fullyanonymous test from the anonymous pollwhy is it that 67% of you particles afair test we are actually creating itsuffice it to say the average is not 90%why did you think it's a pain yesyou didn't have to make me happy becauseyou didn't even know who was voting YESyeah very close yes possibly but yessome big packet of interpreter Iquestionsright some I sample them and give themto you in terms of describing thoseproblems in class as well as inhomeworks and I also sample them andgive some of them has your test to theextent that is fair it is because youbelieve that the distribution with whichyou were dreaming what more are lesssimilarly the distribution with whichyou were tested you did decide that if Idid do well on the testit must be unfair ah that if I did wellon that test it must have been fair youdo that because that's why I give somany different options he understand I'msaying that's ultimately the notion offaith test as an example so my wifetells me the story that when she was shethe professor a collection engineeringdepartment and when she took algorithmscores at Maryland this professoressentially spent the end semestertalking about tractable are their limbsand the last one V just last one weekmaybe even less then last one we talkingabout the theory of np-completeness onhow to prove that some problems are abit weak and then the entire test wasproved this to me I become a true thisnot B&B career in my life with theprofessor you know professor she meanswe have done well in yes otherwise youhave in process and still she remembersthis as like the most unfair test to theextent that there was a classmate ofours in that particular class cal course- a boy's son who is actually aprofessor in the computer sciencedepartment and many many years later butstill before now they was matchsomewhere and they said to each otherand in about three minutes later therewhat can you believe that stupid yes I'msaying that's what an unfair test feelslike it also shows that professors havenothing else read about life that's whatan unfair test is like so have youactually describe what unfair test pieceof history which is the training andtest samples are derived with the samedistribution if they are not it's noteven a learning problem do youunderstand what I'm sayingso in fact you can better be done then Igive you a networks examit's a test there's some points but itdoesn't have any connection is notalready problem Lorna has a people onlywhen the training and best distributionsare the same and that case even underthat case some learners are good learnersomewhere as a bad learners not bad in asecond any judgment away some are slowlearners some are faster glimmers somerequire a lot more examples to learn theconcept some require fewer examples tolearn the concept some how many ourexamples you give that they will learnyou'll never learn the facts but subClub imagine giving perceptron tenmillion examples of Margit exotic it'sbrain is too small okay so that is whereyou wind up talking about thedifferences in learners so distributionassumptions are taking a test data isbasically learning is feasible onlyunder the assumption that the trainingour test samples are taken from the samedistribution now this is not always truein the real world like my wife was givenan exam which was not a fair test okaysimilarly youthey'll have trained your learner tofigure out that gender let's say of aperson using Onix all the photographsthat you have around you like maybe bookyou ask google show me some pictures andthen you trade using them as thetraining data and you can tell whetherAmerica
