October 3 plus 2 power 2 plus 2 part 1bitch might have been terribly stupefiedmathworkscomplete Bayes Network essentially saysI think everything is an activity inwhich get the worst you can do is youhave to specify 32 hoursthe only question would be whether youwork this way conditional probabilitynumbers are you specified JointDistribution the only difference inevery other case when certain thingsright then you would essentiallybasically bind up making this conditionyou will find out making fewer numbersif you want to be a conditionalprobability and then you multiply themyou will multiply and in fact yourcomputer science part of your backgroundwould say if I need to just answer asingle babyI don't first generate the entire joydistribution across the whole point inlogic we did right away right the tryingdistribution if you have atomicvariables we will try to do what atpresent to think we also figured outthis notion of proof chaotic inferencewhich can be in the worst yet as betterone of their difference but in the bestcase it can be much much better that'swhat pays for the inference tasknobody actually converts this into thisbut this is the only way you know thatthe theory would understand what I'msaying just like we thought of in thecase of in the case of resolutionyou try to prove that resolution as awho is a sound by going back to tablesbut the last time you routed the truthtables proof theorem when you prove toyou just to refutation Bayesianinferenceokay so you pretty much know everythingthat's important to draw one is rememberyou saw this picture before I just startoff sorry now you have a display ofunderstand easy okayin particular this was theepistemological commitment which is whatdo you think the world is made of is ittrue truth and falsity availing betweenokay and and they are mean basically isthe ontological commitment and this andthe probabilistic and a propositionallogic ontological commitment isbasically what the world is made of andand in the case of obviously Chris witha knowledge state is degree of belief inthe case of propositional logicit's basically it is true our Fox shouldbe able to same denominators and interms of water water itself is mengapait turns out both probabilistic logicand propositional logic make the sameassumption about the world they believethat the world is made up of singlecolored bubbles the words we perceive aswe come back around basically said theworld is made up of statements whichcame in the single the statement canhave a truth which is this variousnetworks and understanding which is whyour entire example was forceful and[Music]okay and you should watch him aninteresting ECM 50th anniversary paneland neural networks depending which sheactually moderated Vegas because he isthe kind of guy who first wants to knowis there a kid before using engineersbasically want to use it an elbowfurther okay so baby from classic placewhere he looks at me and says what doyou teach in your networks how do youspend the whole system you are thinkingthere are spiders there is channelingthat's all have some vision smoke andmirrors in the end the question issemantics we don't have full semanticsfor many things he's the guy for $70right but he also over the guy behindinvisibility yeah behindand it's also a guy who was behind theempty pathology and basically said thatprism when you go deeper you miss youthe back it's not because that gives youmore accuracy it's because mostreasonable games will have shallow trapsso when you poor people you're gettingextra knowledge because you always doevaluationonly if it's not a clear-cut in a boxthe shower clogging the clink are notliable if you are a to playing chesswhere you're you know you can checkmated and you're basically the game isdone you should be dangerous so that'swhat you say and so that's basically isthe guy behind that one last thing Iwant to ask you about this what kind ofwhat do you want to leave we talkedabout this picture right you could havea word where you stand on a consolealong okay you get through the worldwhere this networks you you can live inthe one that I only mentioned one bodywhere they are basically one of the guyscan have four pedals will have threeparents out of the desertthat's a completely connected which thatwhich one would you like to do the agentif your article using less power you sayover this is nothing you can do tochange anything everything isindependent of unity you have isindependent of your values in this whichis what's the point in livingI understand you showing up to the classis not directly connected to your claimif you will grade in this class dependson everything you do your shot whetheror not you have a particular kind ofserial on September 14 every possiblething then it's a really interesting oneto my interestwe're to entrust everything to anyaction here you can add all the all youwantnothing changes you see what I'm sayingin the other gives you one have freedomacting ignorant here is the questionso John might be calling for reasonsother than alarm going up have youcaptured her have you captured I'm Johnthere latelyI'll just become a Honda versa becausesometimes might be take a showersometimes it's these probabilities tocapture your ignorance aggressivenessone mastic imagine I just give you thesetables everything is empty the numbersare ranging remember if you're giving abase network through some bozo expert asthey put numbers equal to put numbersand you tell them just[Music]and if you medium numbers can be put inand they won't really kaboom then youare like 99% this is what happens whenyour quote unquote learning thesenumbers in in and that was difficult itand you are saying it something isworking nothing like kaboom so far youright now not ending the world is a verysad low expectation[Music]
