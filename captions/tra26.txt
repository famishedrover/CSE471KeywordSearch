this is simple stuff you should be ableto walk through yourself right so Ishould be able to write down intoparticular case there whatever leavethree guys ABC night that means thereare eight words one two three big wordsbut each wordI should be able to write for each ofthese gentlemen are there truth valueit's like for example here what is thetruth value of they are see is falseseems true so this is true right so Ishould be then able to put down the truefalsity values for each of them and Ican fill up this table if I feel at thetable that's how it looks but up untilthis is what you will be given if youfill up this table this is for AR seethis is what we are not see this is forknowledge means mass which means theconjunction of these two colors rightnow face is the two sentences togetherso connection of the two powers okay andthen this is the alpha alpha isbasically what falafelalpha is yeah so now I basically focuson just these to follow and to see wejump the rows where knowledge bases tothe nagas place is true in these tworows and in these tools everywhere hasits faultsI'm not holding any rap and in each ofthese rows is true for true not true andthat's what at MIT if you have 10,000propositions your itemized table whichto part a thousand rows then keep on askUTS give me more paper tearing of paperlike all these rows and thenalso come on money we dead you wanna beable to do it this way you need a pastorright but this is one way of doingthings you want to understand how to dothese model okay okay not actually yeahso the other thing other we have doingthings here is I'm going to make a newpoll that maybe are not alpha and I wantto prove to myself that maybe are notall size as unsatisfiable as that Johncame to the party chanting comfortableremember you thought those are foodanybody interests would be interested inwriting sentences that have unsatisfiedwell I am I am interested in writing kVand not alpha and hoping that it will beunsatisfied because unsatisfiable thatalpha is a tail if it is satisfiableeven in one row and then it's not a careyou see what I'm saying okaybut clearly you can basically have thatand so you had a toxic they gave me amodel path and thankfully you know somefalse false false true false true andtrue I'm sorry I'm KB and not awkward bythe way this is this is not so I shouldhave one more whatever is out by sayingI'm to take the negation so KB is falsenot out by the two powers and prove itfalse false true false false and falsefalse true and false false true andfalse false false and false falseif I have to for 10,000 I will take lotmore classes right so this is what iscalled model karate inferenceokay here's a question what if andknowledge base was John gave the partyjoint income the party did you ever saywhat if I have one of these people on myglutesI said look John take the body turningturns over so how many in that is how itwill be fascinating right and then passand anything else will still be false soby this rule I will say every fact is atake I mean big trouble ah what did youunderstand when they say if my knowledgebase is inconsistent that means it hasno models then this seems to be tellingme how many of you think it's a rock howmany of you know some proofs which show1 equal to 2 in the end if you go yoChris Cruz I am I take this followingvery simple this is one you know most ofthe one equal to two proofs ultimatelyspark with the premise that is falsefrom falseeverything can be proved like forexample they will try to save 0 by 0 hasa value of 0 but 0 has every man you seewhat I'm saying so in fact until it iscompletely valid if your knowledge baseis interestednow my question is do any asked you herewe are talking about no those of you whodon't believe any inconsistent facts inyour head so the first row not aboutcivilians so question any of you we needit consistent things in your head do yousay everything is the following fromthat so are you using logic if you everbelieve what two facts that are mutuallyinconsistent and you are still able tosomehow live you're not using logicthank goodness because watching themovement is one inconsistency in theknowledge base everything is true thisis by design it's not a part it's afeature okay you will use agnostic likeforever you know about this issue infact this is a same thing for examplefalse so basically from false you canentail anything and that's exactly whatlike rows in which knowledge base istrue would be empty rows there are norows bases my only question is is oftentrue in every row warehouse place istrue yes or no yes and you give me aworld where house bases to our files no you can'tin which case off I think this is one ofthese things that people have understandabout logical inference that you alwaystaken for granted from false followersitokay before we go into the resolutionthat could stand apart which is going tobe next minute session let me mentionsomething is constraint satisfaction ifyou have basically what I did in thislast problem here is I was trying tosolve a problem say here is a logicalsentence can you prove it isunsatisfiable so it's what's on theboolean unsatisfiability power how manyof you heard of boolean satisfiabilityproblem boolean satisfiability problemessentially is given a propositionallogic formula is there a single word atleast where that formula evaluates andit should give me that one do youunderstand what I'm saying so did youguys hear of things like NP completenesshow did I pick up is a sample what wasthe original and pick up a problem whatis the original np-complete problem whatis the problem that somebody first haveto show before the very holistic afitness theorem what is for any randomproblem you say this this godforsakenproblem can be reduced to that so thatif you can solve that in this problemfor the world and you are nobodybelieves this problem can be sonic BonAppetite what is the problemboolean satisfiability Stephen cook GodTuring award for showing that booleansatisfiability problem cannotof polynomial time solution unlesspeople there that's the original andpick up in August I whip this up but Icome you know huge climax on a flat it'svery important to know put insatisfactory I mean propositional logicpermeates computer science this calculusclass you are supposed to have about along back and you are being made toremember again but there are stuff thestuff like the discrete map that you didthis is basically boolean logic is wellconnected to this big map all youralgorithms and the complexity theory areconnected would it satisfiabilityproblem essentially is this problemgiven a bunch of clauses and all thisone says this basically PSU is PR sparty okay and then not P - Q comma Q isnot P and so on given a bunch of theseclasses can you tell me two points Pvalues of V s QR etc such that allsentence of successful every class canbe thought of as a constraint and youare trying to find their model where allconstraints are satisfiedthis is boolean constraint satisfiedokay so model checking is that we dotake really I think more minutes and Ijust want you to understand that tosolve problems like that and gives amuch simpler version of that problemhere is a party problem constraint is one is either jodean firm orcountythe concern is is a bomb in our moredeep comfortable and stay three isGeordi come on what instable my questionis is there a party that I can throwwhere all these three constraints aresatisfied in fact I can think of this asour friends who don't get along and I'mgoing to throw a party okay and if youknow basically either I should not sothese are my constraints on my partyparty timemy question is these data configurationof parties that I can throw where I cantell who and send their bodies and onlythose people and then the question thenis how do you solve this one idea ofcourse to do this in five table likethis now it turns out that constraintsatisfaction problems of this type areextremely useful for example they can beused in fact evening they can be used inscheduling of jobs they can be watchesof this especially I've used in yourairline has been Caitlyn schedule acrossokay times of the time the way airlineschedule they through their privatesector logisiticsand of all the important things to dothey're all essentially booleansatisfiability go the dumb way of doingit is not an issue which big table thesimple way of doing it is here than asearch technique currently you startwith some dad Joe okay and eitherJoe is coming to the party or not comingto the party if Joyce family dinnerparty then I'll consider some other thanTom Ince party some in the party arebottom to the bar and so if I expandthis tree and the leaves notthe party nominations the only questionis is constraint is violated in anyplace during this research I can spotthat all - he was upset because once theconstraint is violated it's not going toimprove so this is a beautiful searchthing I just essentially consideredvariables as the search nodes and itconsidered their values the differentbranches and any time the currentpartial party is already sunk becauseit's violating one of the constraints Iwould expand it any furtherso I told you boolean satisfiability Isaid it's a great problem I said it'sactually search if I am doing thissearch two questions before you gowhat's that you deduce that was ourdepth-firsthow many people think they want to hisdirect first ones how many people whowant to use gap first furnace you betteruse depth first our parties are createdequal our successful parties are nearlyequal you just want to find once accessof ideas right depth first you forgotthe whole thing I'm telling you that youshould use them now the second questionand then we will really go into theexterior session would you use nativedeepening depth-first just mother howstupid should you feel if you useiterative deepening of what no no no whywould you not but all successful partiesare at the third level if I ever want tobe be a search tree and said that allbowls appear in the neighbors is deepand you want to do iterative deepeningdepth-first searchwho are you trying to dress constraintsatisfaction problems are solved bydepth-first search directly they stophere we let one go and[Music][Music][Music][Music]okay okayvibration we were trying to kind of stirto clear impunity we wanted to proveknowing what you know is a sentencemaintained and we actually found thatshaking entailment it was as one way oftaking a Tillman is actually provingunsatisfiability boolean satisfiabilityso in fact in logic in words there arereally two kinds of problems[Music]okay there are two groups entailmentsatisfiability those are the two mostimportant problems in any logic one isgiven a bunch of logical constraints isthere a model that satisfies half theconstituency the other is even you havea bunch of constraints can you writethis as a constraint that obvious motiveand all these other constraint servicepeople understand what I just saidthis is the you know yarn a logicsatisfiability here improve so in factsatisfiability and entailment our modelchecking these two is basicallysatisfiability and here improvingis David okay remember I said booleansatisfiability is np-complete so youknow that proposition of water checkingis that becomes a problem so what isproportional theorem proving complexityit's a conjugate problemso it's onp dumping as far as you'reconcerned hot rod okay[Music]so you cover the science we talk aboutcomplexity in terms of and be harder inNP completeness and Hahira booleansatisfiability an np-complete problemokay and it turns out that yeah it turnsout that a Dillman is nothing butboolean unsatisfiability because given aboolean given an attainment antientailment problem there is anequivalent boolean unsatisfiabilityproblem yes exactly that's exactly whatwe did when we threw this KB had notgone fast like I said it's alpha so manataking a theorem proving arginine youngin fact they are connected so the goodsolutions for model checking booleansatisfiability would be much better thanjust the one that I showed you which isalready very good because as soon asthat search tree you get a partialassignment that is deadyou can stop search that's a huge willbut there are other things that you cando which involve as part of doing modelchecking usually production improvingand those are from constraintsatisfaction with literature those arecall constraint propagation techniquesand if you do that it will cut down thesearch so model chicken can help improveawakener we can have merging and they'reyin and yang there's a whole bunch ofstuff here that you can look at butthat's according to but now what we wantto do is the syntax of the inference forspeak get you to a point where at leastwe start off here is that thispropositionokay so here are some rules that arefounded but incomplete okay so forexample the modest bonus room things I'mgreen omelette and the thing in blue isthe freedom as attained okay so if everyprice P and then n plus B is true and itis true then B is true okay then so youget rightly as in a visit they similarlymodels for tolerance if a implies B istrue or not B is true then you get towrite nothingsimilarly modest vitamins this isactually not a fool what as hypothesisimplies B is true is not truecan you say B is not true do you seewhat I'm saying replace B just becauseit is not true doesn't it be won't betrue because somebody has put up wewould be maybe connected to both a and Wfor example and happy is to serve easingit this is what I'm sayingremember the medium let me see aknowledge base it is alpha you are onlysaying that these are all the placeswhere alpha is true you just unhappyenough if in the few words the knowledgebase is true in alpha is 2 or so it iswhat I'm sayingso it could be true in some other placestoo and that's the reason why not aimplies it's a plus B and money does notmean do not be by the way how do youprove this how do you prove that this isfound on our song okay it turns outwhich is a nice little thing and this isby the way if I must tell you this is ahomework problemthis is the kind of stuff that you couldcheck to see whether you understoodthese concepts okay so for example howgirly prove modest Collins is soundbasically light on the truth table itimplies be the knowledge base will neverbe a be an octave and then I will writenot yet and then I will check if in factin all the rows in our case it's truethis is the first principle smooth youcan also it turns out that if you havealready proved some other rules to besounded you can use them to prove thisrule to be something that's alsopossible in fact we will do that in thelater yes what does this actually checksoundness this is always a rejection asong if you can do this it's somecompleteness on the other hand has to bedone by mathematical induction you candisprove completeness by giving anexample a counter example then I knowthis is a tail and you are unable toprove itis what I'm sayingokay so I would like for example showthat correspondence is definitely notcomplete I can write the following thingeither Tom came to the party Tom did notcome to the body it's nothing wrong inwriting that by the way come into theparty and pound did not give the what isThatcher if I indicated they are allsyntactically correct and you know onein which they are satisfied Tom came tothe party I did come to the party it'sactually college because of unit oneit's true in everyone okayand you Sparky John is happyit's gone deep calm John is happy myquestion is do you know John is happywho said no this if you're unhappy guyyou don't want to make John happy justlook at this you hear it out the worldcan only be the car came around in cuffsif some kill Jonathan if fountain comeJohn's still happy rightcan you prove this using modus ponensonly modus ponens this is the counterexample showing waters ponens isincomplete in fact this is a greatcouple example to remember this requiresyeah this requires is analysis right itrequires case analysis you have toconsider the case right and killed andthe case where come did come inside thisis not doesn't have to be actually isnot happy topology here is our versioneither on John okayand if mainly comes to the party John ishappy comes to the party you need Johnin here John happy againyes case analysis John to the partyeither which way John is happy so Johnis a modest ponens cannot do this you dothat first of all you agree that thisfrom your reasoning you see that John ishappy to actually prove that is anddo your truth table okayI'm sure that in every role where arethe intention of these three things istrueJohn happens in fact these are theexercises to make sure that youunderstood through either piece of thisone of them by think table method thatmeans it's actually a big and yet modestwarrants is not allowing you to showthat is ending you see what I'm sayingthat's why my son is in Italysimilarly you know there are things likechanging rules if a plus B if I see thenimply see that's a new group thatactually is also true that's a soundokay so it turns out that if you justuse modus ponens you can prove sometheorems for novel theorems how many ofyou heard from Locke for a lot basicallywithout that operator essentially amodest proponents sour one exponents isactually not more intuitive thisanalysis is hard for us this one is easybut if I have if the world is dividedinto 10,000 cases to check thatsomething is holding I need to checkthat all those cases of that thing isfor you why the painful thing what wewould normally that's those are theplaces where logical paradoxes so modestponens it turns out actually if you justdo morris ponens and to prove a theoremthen it will only be take the polynomialtime it won't take exponential time eventhough full theorem proving is emptyhard just the part where you can youonly use models for answer true that isonly for nowdo you see what I'm saying okay again interms of just complete but unsung as Isaid a small magic when you say foreverything you say yes it's ending inwhich case you'll also have said it forother things that are too damn dangerouseternity because of which your vacuumasleep he uses that lets us come to theso actually this one is basicallyshowing why this other path is showingshowing why modest qui tollis is anunsound what is quite honestly the mansome inference just as I showed one isminutes for this one's I showed theother ones are sound basically and wewould show that there are two placesaround face is true in only one of theplaces the path is true not veryresponsive so you put out retaileractivate so item it then you show usominous okay so so how about some handcomplete this is miss any what this is avariation of that problem that meetingplace J naught W plus J 2 modus ponensfound if I wait what you know it is truebecause it can take okay okay so thatbrings us to this last rule resolutionokay all it is basically saying is ifyou happen to have statements of thefollowing form alpha beta and not withour gamma they alpha beta gamma are allpropositionsthat means you're only allowingsentences in this form where each of thesentences in your mouth ways have to bewater called disjunctive clauses aclause
