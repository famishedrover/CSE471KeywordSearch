okay I just established this there arefour minutes faster so I they would keeptrack of the time so you know what don'tget carried away by that and you knowit's like use number of people gettingup since the flow as to why there shouldbe a flow in the last four minutes Isaid why not for the classthey actually got more from the lectureand the chapters obvious like my voice Idon't know and then finally another 38%said if you kill something out of theclass but when you weaker than prospectsso I try to be positive okay so I'massuming I'm going to forget theresomething that you things that you'resupposed to have done one is to have alook at the lecture on the agenda - it'sjust that I'm more or less gonna assumethat you read and then I'm just keepingthe slides if there are any questionsyou can ask me then I will assume thatyou let the blind search chapter it'sone of those things where normally if Iask you to read the chapter I don'tassume that I do not have power againbecause the first time you read you maynot understand everything but whensearch possibly is one of those areaswhich you probably don't because youhave done different kinds of line searchalgorithms at that depth first that wasdefinitely in your t10 we will actuallytake a first look at them very quicklyas you probably saw from the textbookare if you saw the lecture again forthat particular part and then there wassomeone but one interesting idea that wehad which you probably never heard ofwhich is an iterative deepeningdepth-first search which is actually theidea and that also explains to you oneof the important points which meansyou're assuming huge trees you'reassuming huge tween is so much so thatyou go quite deep and if you're going Tthen essentially you know this on yourown after eat em ah that in a binarytree for example there are as many nodesin the last whether there are otherlevels combined you know this right maxso that's also true you know that's beenmore true for higher branching factortrees there are B power D notes and thedepth fire you know deputy andeverything else part of just about comesto be power okay so that's why in factiterated between that for selectingworks in certain cases and I hope youalso got the idea which will begindouble check that the reason people welove back that first search is it takeslinear memory and in fact one big issuetends to be you may have great patiencebut you don't have infinite space onyour computer and if the computeractually requires one byte more than itsprototypicalit just dies between them so their basicnon sequiturso in some sense we do want to try andlook at some events that spacecomplexity in addition to the timecomplexitywell then hopefully we'll start movingtowards the cost-sensitive andincarceration by the end of today'sclass and that would be the main pointof next class okayso in terms of the architectures for achange we you must have looked at thesesimple reflex agents reflex a liquidstate and go to a state density basedmethods and this simple respects areum'sbasically in essence is taking what'sthrough some information from theenvironment and it start after him withno condition action rules but it can besome arbitrary point these rules don'thave to be boots they can be somearbitrary constants okaya duplex agent essentially it's thestate and decides what action andstrangely okay because what they do isthey essentially compile the state ofthe world as well as they go as well asthe what the opponent has done up untilnowand they say if the state of the worldhas done this and I have done thefollowing week until now then the nextaction I should do is this tax this taxagent okay so even though in thischapter we try to make fun of reflexagents sometimes you can combine thingsinto a reflex agent okay so that'suseful to keep in mind then if theMystics agent actually keeps track ofState in fact when I was talking aboutour goal reallyit was reflex agent plus and in Twitterbecause it's keeping track of fatalitiesI was just assuming that the state mayhave put into the condition if you dothat them it'll get affectionate andwith respect to the state but not onlythis will be a more useful view thatthis agent requires information aboutthe spirit it requires some informationabout how the world evolves this is mykind of place where if the worldactually static the world doesn't evolveso wherever it is it just stays thereokay if it is a dynamic word then whereyour mouth will keep the world is changea state of the world is change so thatinformation has to be pointed I don'twant to my actions which is basicallywhat we looked at last time if I do thisaction this is how the state of theenvironment will change okay and andthen of course using this so this isbasically reflects events which state Iwould say this is basically connected toour ghosts and things okay this one isactually here in some sense there's nocode here because the other one the goalbased agent has a goal as we gookay here is the quality if I if youpick something as an input that meansyou're flexible with respect to that doyou understand what I'm saying so thisgame will never ask what you go becausethe goal has been built into thecondition action rules there is really aparticular goal that you possibly bedoing if you're laying out for them wejust want to be in the game exceptletting go you just want to be the gameif you play chess you wanted in the gameand the rules of chess and all go havealready be decided and so I don't needto tell you every time they go with thegame so you can just kind of compilethat II when you compile that you thereis no separateyes okay but in general we don't knowwhat our goal should be when we wake upin the morning an intelligent agentbasically has to also figure out whatits goals are and how to make progresstowards so in one way of looking at thisset of these architectures is to saythat they are increasing the flexibilityof the agent it can take new problemsand still do that and remember what Isaid in the very beginning of the classthat computers are already better thanyou in anything the only thing that youhave going for you is the flexibility doyou see what I'm sayingso in some sense essentially that's whatyou do when you go forward so if you'rehappy to do what your body's then youcan just you know build it in you cancompile it into the architecture andthat's it you don't need to think at thetime of the filing you don't need tothink anymore why do you just look upthe table there's a huge big table intowhich it's a function it's a hugefunction that's what the neural networkunderlying is actually imaging and thisfunction tells you these these are truethis is the actual easy for you you seewhat I'm saying okay so it looks as ifhumans normally may have some thingsthat they can be reflexively but manythings they think whether this is alsoconnected start no repeating to system 1and system 2 stuff system 1 basic itthis is like what an organ and what isit that we have a system on which justmakes the sexy magiciansyou walk in I look at your analyticschild yeah babies not heart okay youcome up with these very quick decisionsand then system two is the one that sortof slowly deliberates to see if in factyour impulses were actually right andhuman evolution depended on school likeI said every time you see a tiger if youhang around and try to figure outwhether or not this tiger is from a goodfamily and maybe won't bite you orsomething you'd be dead so you have tohave both reflects as well as thedeliberation as we move into thesearchitectures the native architecturesallow front de libération but thenwhenever I provide up front delibération then you can also compile itafter in fact for example if I just toldyou if you just saw yourself aparticular College problem you canremember for this I had this G this isthe answer so if I give the exact sameproblem again you don't have to startfrom scratch so second time around hebecame reflexive but the first timearound you actually reason from firstprinciples and human civilization alwaysback that me every time for example thefirst time you heard about derivativesthe first time mathematicians thoughtabout derivatives they thought of it asa limit H tends to 0 at X plus h minusFX by H when was the last time youactually tried to compute the derivativethat means you essentially said Ohdeeper DXL my DX is an Excel power nminus 1 this is a little chapter so ifyou ever see X power and spit out theanswer if you ever see sign it's spitout the answer if you ever see Rocketsspit out the answer what is the log X nunu by the way it's very important inthis class okay so if you have to spitout these answers but if I give yougo back to the first principles this isa back squat the flexibility isotherwise you're just basically a lookuptable if you make you one of lookuptable you're intelligent if you'redependent on somebody else's lookuptable you are not in Africa okay sothat's about reflexes and it statesalready do a whole bunch here you keepall this information and then you usethis and so in some sense this nearly isalmost close to one half ago with usthis is the kind of architecture theyhave we see what I'm saying much of thismay well be combined into this bigfunction but essentially that's what youknow the information yes so it isremembering I'm not putting agents theway agent updated each state but it'sbasically have been updated by thesensor information that's a good pointokay so this is something that I spent abunch of time actually let me get backto this next oneyep okay let me do this bus so thenthere is a cool place midget and thedifference between the don't waste agentand the reflex agent with state is verylittle it's just that you take as inputgoals by the way Achille pleaseunderstand if you take as inputadditional parameters of the problem yoube most vexing right if you ever come tothe exam actually don't give me thepaper I know the answers already thatmeans you just assume you know you sortof saw some you know fake example forsomewhere and we just assumed that wouldbe a series of people and you startedwriting those answers you see what I'msaying okay so in fact piggy goes asinput shows that you're more flexibleyou can clearly multiple different kindsof things at least your element and thenyou take the city and how the worldevolves now this is one of theinteresting questions includes to alsothe previous one is when you have stateinformation types of reasoning that itinvolves for example how did the stateyou want what current what is thecurrent state now you think you shouldknow the ground state because thesensory information is coming in butthat's not true because your sensesmight be reaching you only get partialinformation right so for example just toput this in perspective if you'redriving at some point of time you passthis guy on the right hand side rightright hand side of that lane to theright of you and after a while you lookback this car in the rearview mirror isa car still there or not it could be inthe blind spot if you just saw a fewseconds after you pass the car you arenot seeing that are in the deep mirrorin your blind spot and that point justachieving over since I don't see a carit's all completely fine car less likelymy let me get into the right land wouldcause lots of problems so would youactually update your state yes thesensors are saying there's no car butthree seconds back that themselves toldme there was a car and I know how theworld works there are more atomic carswhich just zoom past and so they'reactually must be a car still either Iplan it just is fact in my life this isthe reasoning you do okay and then thenso you have a sense of the world is andthen you ask yourself what should I doif I were to do an action what the worldwould look like this is simulated muchof what is happening here is simulatingindirect if you simulate the world inyour head you never get injured thisone's it if you actually try to do anaction there here what you might gounder there what if you think of doingthis action in your head you don't dieso in fact a lot of intelligence isability to simulate the real world inyour LeClairthat's how do you actually survive weare able to sometimes you have to dostuff in the world to figure out whathappens but many a time you have oilystuff you can think about what willhappen if I do this because you haveknowledge about the world you havemodels of the world so you canessentially simulate the world in yourheadokay so then if you have thatinformation then I know the pose if Ihave this information on our other goalsthen I should ask what should the actionbe that I should do next you can almostsee that in the problem-solvingStates agent which you looked at for thesearch algorithms essentially this isthe char generator function okay and thegoal is a goal test functionand this stuff is the search operatorwhat action should I do now isessentially there are many differentways of instantiating this but the firstone is making an hour procedure justmake them pieces of pork and even if youdo that you can essentially do you canessentially do reasoning you know whatyou can hear in the world because youcan research algorithmsokay and math I want to actually go backand point out that what I said here isthis is my token of issue from thearchitectures of the agents that youwant to keep in mind which is but thesimplest agents assume the states areatomic that is their black boxes they'reindivisible black boxes problem solvingagent at the program level essentiallydoesn't even want extraneous whatignores is the state black box and thenit gives it to the child generator itgives more chips you know state blackboxes and then it gives each of their tothe goal destination goal test code andthe goal test is yes it's a go to younot stop otherwise you keep on doing itthat's what you found and the differencebetween all the search of the wimpsturns out to be the order in which youmake the next shiny and next known toexpand expand essentially means appliesa child generate a function problempopping a debt level we think in termsof atomic agents state spaces areirreducible there is no interfacefunction your SUV okay and under thefocus will be in search on atomic Statesand in fact if you think of a starsearch and the next idea that we'll lookat in this class which is Markovdecision processes the both will befirst presented at the atomic level it'salways done that way and then you saythiswithout question with the strips ofstructure there for example you knowhere is one way of a minute the statesmight actually be made of features andif they're binary and boolean picturesthen essentially you tell that afterpositionally represented state now if astate has a mint state variables andthere are boolean so they can all beindependently true or false which meanswith these end state variables you canrepresent to power and different stateswhat did you do just now what you did isthe proportional representation allowsfor compactness of the representationthis what I'm saying you can rememberthe word which is 2 power n States largetill just 10 weeks and which have aboolean state a differenceso that's propositional will then alsopropositional representationsessentially a machine learn Englishperspective and many unfortunately manyof you have kind of heard about thatstuffyou can think of propositional as Egyptexcept a feature really doesn't have tobe a feature a feature can bemultivalued in fact nama machinelearning initiative says a feature canbe continuous valued a multi valueddiscrete variable are fully respectedokayso here we'll pick up on this levelthinking some propositional withdiscrete boolean variables that's thefirst entry violence okay so states aremade up state variables are take valuesand the proposition or multi values arecontinuous and then what you can then doit a to search as well asin some other states which willunderstand when we get to something likepropositional logic if the followingstate variable is true with this othervariable also be true because they haveconnections they have dependenciesbetween the variables okay and thenthere is an additional representationhere essentially is an illogicalsemantics perspective what you will feelis that essentially the world is made upof two false statements okay so in somesense going from everything one is madeup of individual states here you thinkthe more it is made up of two falsestatements here you come to Richmond youthink the world is made up of objectsand the relations between them and thenwhen you come here Hesperia is actuallysimilar we also can allow functions overobjects and a strange way of thinkingabout this is the day you learnprogramming languages from assemblylanguage to any high-level programminglanguage especially things likeobject-oriented programming languagesessentially assume that the program istalking about States of differentobjects so you mimic what is this thingcalled ontological commitmentontological commitment that my wordcontains objects and relations betweenthem okay I'm going to try to look for alanguage that allow me to representthat's where your logics okay and theother thing of course so this is aexample that you should go throughhopefully you went through carefullythat it's a same problem can berepresented there are I mean ourrelational representations and one funnything that actually profits of thegradient to is on one hand Ireduce problem-solving agency as ifthey're only doing search in the spaceof atomic states but often times theyactually say that states are made up ofstate variables do you see what I'msaying some of the examples we look atyou will see that stuff that states aremade up of just invisible thepresentation sometimes it's are betterfor state roads you know for example forthe 8 puzzle problem that you probablylook take that you must have looked atwhen you look at the search algorithmsthen you basically talked about wherethe blankies and where each other is areeither in the opposite the differencebasically is that the search out willthen we kill it in that in its innardsdouble to any difference under stateinterval for example say if this statevariable is true this great when evil istrue which is our variable major itwon't ask those kinds of questionsit was just a presentation ofconvenience that you might do okay yesso that's a really good point actuallyin general let's all let me say twothings one is I haven't seen my lectureI gave it in 2012 so I'm trying tofigure out what I might have some in2012 what is included but secondly Ithink I know where you're going which isif I give you state variables in theworst case if there are any booleanstate variables in the worst case therewill be two power and mid-stage itdoesn't have to be some of those statesmight actually exist what the agent cannever get to them do you understand whatI'm sayingso this is the kind of thing you'retalking about so for example in thisthis actually causes all sorts ofinteresting questions about what aregood works of bad representations okayso one of the things that might happenis I will get to this in the 8 puzzleproblem it was a problem as boring as itis and as painful as it is for you guysbecausethem's actually played a huge role getthe ketchup back when you knowapparently this guy called you knowinstigate 315 person so it could bethree by three with a plan 15 will befour by four with a blank you see okayand then so Sam Boyd essentiallydispositive this is the main personproblemokay I'm sick found it I just move theblanks around until you get essentiallyeverything in that I died so here ofcourse 14 and 15 and the letters arethat is put it finally looks that'sright it's easy no problem and this guyis going crazy because it turns outgiven the legal moves of a puzzle giventhe legal moves of a preserve its statespace is Rickey two disconnectedcomponents this is almost like this someof Inception a test of our kind of stuffyou know different words okay given themoves of the 8 puzzle problem the statespace is split into disconnectedcomponents and if you are one componentdoing operations will only keep you inthat community and never be able to getto higher groundthe easiest way of getting to the othercomponent because a tesseract so to saywould be it two times for themphysicallydid you ever say that's what Sam Morganso those what we did spend learningcombinatorics little ahead of the restof the bozos got you lot of thing yousee what I'm sayingso this gives you an answer to someextent that in fact you might tell arguewhy can't I come up with arepresentation which only corresponds toone in only allows legal operations suchthat as soon as they give me this taskthe initial state will say the problemCaracas I am sorry Appa Lydia problemsis a problem in itself if I give you aproblem and you have to say somefavorable they need to do be that tomake some extremely search and find thatthere's no that point you can't just gothere and say I'm getting bored I thinkif I decide this you're insanefirst appearing actually a deep questionessentially in general for anyrepresentation they can come up with anarbitrary assignment of feature valuesmight correspond to states that arephysically impossible what I meanphysically possible is that the legaloperation there is no sequence of legaloperation starting from the initialstate and never get you the worst[Music]actually this is the problem everythingthat we are talking about has linearsome layers of complexity so if you askquestion that's the way I can get intothat you can slow me down I will try togo fast if it's possible but anybody canslow me down we're asking questionsthat's your way by the way what's yournamewhat yeah remember people say the namesokay so anyway this is the summer I saidthat the text the course is essentiallypresentations because you want to knowyou want to look at how to search sothere were search of the film's MVPsand the s power circuits are quite somehere and there will be this otherelephant in the room which is learningacquiring the model so I would not saylearning I'm just saying who gave me themodel and that's what actually got methrough despite that I hope youunderstood that there are two ways ofgoing about intelligent agent design oneis assume that the models are givenmodel of what will happen if I do thisaction is even more about how the bodybox is given and you kind of have givena representation for the state what arethe relevant state variables to think interms of okay
