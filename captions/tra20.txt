is transition I guess you messed upyesterday was the last difficult afterclass which means your status so veryclearly can I think all the easy daysfor this class are over now that sinceyou cannot believe we have captiveaudience we couldn't make it more funand interesting for us let's see there'sa bunch of things that are coming up ofcourse11:21 I will be here and we have asecond should we say no the other one issupposed to keep we actually have youknow if you general in class whenever Ido me a favor you feel very bad for thatso this is one more sothe final exam on December 12 a.m. to2:00 p.m. okay okay let's see so let'sthat's actually before we go forwardtake a deep breath okay today I justheard that my wife told me that astudent showed up unannounced into ouroffices and broke down because theperson was having a really hard time andthis is that time of the semester andthings suddenly I I heard somebodysaying this is the last the worst weekof my microserver absent Lisa misreadthings move like that please seriously Ithink you should try to not take the endof the semesterpressures too badly okay I mean it benow restored we always keep hearingabout the inside you know around thistime things start looking as if the Viceis creeping up any hard you have alreadypacked in November of this class settinga date I can tell what else is going onin your life but certainly these aregoing to be any harder in fact they'reprobably easier you know and because yougot used to hard life so easy by but andalso honestly somebody else actually theother day said main menuespecially undergrads by the way I knoweverybody's life is hard but I'm gonnaextend to do these crazy seven coursesonline courses becausefor the fall clinics you might ever takeall the credits after University at thesame time once they have $10 justbasically if this you know sit downdon't panic okay things are there's onlyone big project that's the dance of yourproject that has like almost a month todo and that you wanted to have it mostlikely you want to have it on yourresume that's why you were to do thisthe other thing is that I was able tosay that semana grab the other day saidwe made the first sentence what I'm sureyou're disappointed in us please if anyof you are thinking that that's not thecase okay I don't really matter if youare cheered I would have to talk to theempty room so I'm very happy that you'rehere you know since I'm teaching anywayyou know I think it's good that somebodyis trying to get something out of it soyou should not feel worried about askinggirls if you are going through troublein any which meaning with respect tothis course clearly you should feel youshould keep that in mind and so we arenot as hard as as harsh as we might lookso you should take that intoconsideration and that brings us to thistest I gave the test the last test moreto figure out for me the full varianceof the class okay so you can alwaysthere are ways of giving tests imaginethis is the true competence we don'tknow how to really measure it withrespect to here and this is thepercentage on the test you would like tothink that people should be able todesign a test these are words like thatokay that means if he is competent thatis many monotracerthat is many watts it's impossible todesign any test of that kind okay mostof your life you have used tests we moreor less use two tests like this it's gotthis rate okay so if your about okay inunderstanding what's going on in theclass you get 100 and if you actuallyreally get everything I'm saying you'llstill get 100 there's no real differenceokaythese are the tests you are used most ofthe time that's what people do so thatyou feel good the test that was given toyou is more like thisyou see what I'm saying so if those ofyou who had everything going for you youunderstood everything you knew how tobeam with the time etc you did okaythose who basically are not completelysure especially on the true/falsequestions you know the answers will bevery hard unless you really understandthe material okay I don't want to takethat testlet me turn over this way but I give itto you so since we figured this part outI want to give you an easy test will besomething like this okay and it shouldbe something that most people checkslike almost like a sanity testokay the kinds of things that you usedto in other classes that's that you canget done with the exam in the first tenminutes I'll use the next 78 minuteschecking whether or not everything hasbeen done I don't believe in those dayswhen I give that this time so that wewill also have a sense of those two andthe main Woodmoor life might look likethis essentially okay and not only donot like to lose class time but sinceanyway I want me here and I can alwaysask you to watch a video instead andsince the classroom would be availableokay so that's the so it's like this isus doing you a favornow there most likely it will have a bigoverlap with the previous testI'll let you knowah again that's basically and againthose of you okay well I mean take adeep breath especially if you camerunning okay any questions before we goforward okay so today actually it'sgoing to be easy life because it'sforgiven you yet people see the same butit's like that okay so basically whatwe're going to do is actually dopropositional logic which werecompletely glass trying they'reimproving and then look at someapplications of propositional logicespecially the model booleansatisfiability which is a search theoremproving which is a search and I washenough doing actions with propositionallogic which is what without planning butthat's also a search so they're likethree types of search strategies youknow that you will be doing it's likethe good old days of a star searchexcept with a different representationso that's basically what people do okayso in terms of the last time we werehere we were talking about inferencerules for propositional logic and thefact that there exists one niceinference rule that covers them allcalled propositional resolution modusponens not modus tollens but this newrule that you may not have heard ofbefore called proportional resolutionand the solution essentially works aslong as all your knowledge is in thisspecial form on your propositionalknowledge is in this form process infact they're called disjunctive normalform clauses okay and at the end ofclass essentially is a disjunctiona disjunction of some number of liquorsin literal either a proposition symbolor a negationrocket propulsion so that's basicallythe idea and the class lengthessentially is the number of teen yearsin the class so these are our twostudent classes okayour proportional resolution rule says ifyou have to process like this in fact inthis case they happen to be next to eachbut it could be this is 15 like thiscould be 17 length okay as long as whatnumber Carter says let's say apreposition in beta and the other classhas the negation of the preposition notgreater you can sort of cancel them outand write everything else from the firstclass disjoint with everything else fromthe second classthat's what propositional resolutiononlys okay and and be basically fortalked about the fact that you can showthat it's found by essentially tough dowe get truth table so if you're justtrying to show this one you need a truthtable with alpha beta gamma as the threeproposition symbols so there are eightrows okay and so you should be able tofigure out the truth for they the truthbut they think every word and the truthfor the conjunction of them and then thetruth for peace in each of those wordsand sure to yourself that every wordwith a conjunction of those truth istruth I think that you're trying to buyit is also that's the definition ofentertainment if you can show that thenbasically it's a sound root happen firstand I said for completeness actually youneed to actually provide a mathematicalinduction rules and I didn't go throughit you know the textbook has a niceregulator those of you who like a goodattention proof should look it up okaycompetence is obviously harder to provethan soreness but one interesting thingessentially is that if you realize thatif you have the resolutionproving that the solution rule everyother rule is a special case ofresolution okay so for example youwanted to check let us say you wanted tocheck a implies B and here is trueshould allow you to attain beach rightthat's what matterswhat aspirin says yes this this is trueyou can actually see things you approvedthis to be at some room in fact you canactually get this from that okay becausea implies V would be not a heartbeatokay but anyplace be can written as notERV that's the notion of implication inlogical implication and then you havehere you can dissolve in a cancel youget be the same with every room modustollens also the same thing so in factthat's what point of saying this is ageneral rule every other rule is aspecial case of it okay it's kind ofnice stuff especially for those of youwho are new to eat logic for so manydifferent courses if you haven't heardabout resolution rule it's kinda cutethat one rule can do it all okay andthen we talked about the fact that whenyou do you can approve it you can eitherdo the resolution in the forward way soyou just keep on doing a bunch ofresolutions until the theorem that youwant to prove whites are coming out asthe result of one of the resolutions atwhich point you say I'm done you can dothe resolution in the hotel courtresolution refutation way which is youtake the the formula that you want toprove take the negation of it Kamataalso in the passive form add it to theoriginal set of causes people aren'tdoing resolution until you cannot saythat this particular of knowledge baseentails false falsewould look like an empty classessentially in a colossal farm Falls isan empty class you see what I'm sayingokay so in general in fact imagine ofeverything suppose you have a to be toinuvik knowledge base and not it is alsotruth in your knowledge base would youagree that you're not very seasonedconsistent okay so if you if youactually resolve then what would happenit gets cancer within and you get Emilyclose and you know I can pick you outwith a nice little square okay so emptyclass is basically false and so you cando this by just doing a bunch ofresolutions until you find that I thinkit was and in fact resolution excitationis the more general approach it turnsout that we just do forward resolutionthen it's not have to just keep on usingresolution room you have to use someother goals in fact I pointed out lastclass that you might have used byexample goal saying PRP is the same asspeak that's an extra rule right youdon't have to do that if you're justusing verification you just keep onusing with definition once you do thenegation of the goaladding to the knowledge base and keep onpicking some data classes resolving themtake the resolution put it back into theknowledge base until you find an emptyclass okay and as soon as you find anempty class you say I'm done I haveproved that whatever I was trying toprove he's actually attained now I alsopointed out that if in fact the originalknowledge base is already inconsistentmaybe you could have got the integralsfrom the knowledge base itself that'sokay because it's in fact your knowledgebase is inconsistent then every theoremgoes in that knowledge base if you havefalse everything goes in the moregeneral case now space itself is notinconsistent that means they make didexist some holes when your knowledgebase is consistent with but in all thoseworlds the formula that you're trying toproveit's going to be true so if you wantboth my knowledge may is and thenegation of the founder you have nowords leftthat's what resolution excitation isdoing okay fine as I'm seeing this youkind of found out that I'm talking aboutcyllage like because I said take acouple of classes result I'm going toapplause this resolve on a couple ofclasses itself until you find an emptyclass one of the interesting things isas you keep resolving you are making newclasses okay do you see what I'm sayingso in fact this is a search processuntil you find an empty class you haveto keep on resolving and in fact if youwant up trying to prove something that'snot a theorem that means it actually isnot obtained by the knowledge base thenwhat happens you keep on trying to doresolutions these are getting over andyou still did not find an empty classnow the problem of course is if you didfind an empty class after a couple oftimes you can't say that the theorem isnot entertained because maybe you shoulddo more it resolutions until empty classcomes if on the other hand you did everypossible pain of resolutions that'savailable in the knowledge base as wellas the new guys coming in T see what I'msaying as even if I did all of them Istill haven't gotten any class that islike basically a-star search sayingthere is no solution because I amexhausted the search tree do you seewhat I'm saying when can that happenwhen can you exhaust a search treefirst of all the third state should befinite because exist exhausting infinityis beyond ussecondly secondly you should have asystematic search strategy even if youhave a finite three to be able toexhaust and make sure that you havelooked at every node in the tree youshould have a systematic search strategylike either perfect for a star a starone of those things because I mentionedsomething like gradient descent youcouldn't operate in the same in indiscrete search would be really hitwinding we will actually look at anexample of that today hill climbingstrategies may be very fast but they cannever guarantee you that they haveexhausted the search tree do youunderstand this okay so to be able toactually show that a theorem definitelyis not an age you have to have triedevery possible pair of resolutions thatcan have outcome so you should havecarefully kept track of what resolutionsI tried what I haven't tried so it needsto be some sort of a systematic way ofdoing research and then you fell out ofthe search process and you still don'thave an empty class then you know okayso that this is such a process so whatyou're doing here needs to act with thepath database that were in 2004 BC I sawwatch the two slides that I skippedbasically convincing you that everyformula can recover into clausal formyou kind of know that a plus B can beconverted into closet not hey Bobbywhich is a crossover but I'll get tothose two sites in a minute but let'slook at this fast since I made that forpi the word search so I start with thepresent form of the knowledge base thenI may get the goal first then I alsoconvert that into clausal form and now Iadded to BC so now I have a bunch ofclausesSDC plus DG okay then let B be equal toBC plus region and then I'm loopingthrough this some D select a pair ofwhat as a c1 and c2 and without them infact you only can select at colors thatcan be resolved if they basically do nothave resolution then this in the centerif they don't have one of them having aand one half of the other have in not ayou cannot discover them so you have toselect a pair of clauses c1 and c2 fromB that can be resolved which is a quickcheck because we just need to have oneclass has a proposition with onepolarity the other has the sameproposition with the other polarity sowhat in one case P is occurringpositively rather is a Craig negative soyou select these two basic one to thispair of classes and from D it turns outthat you have you select these two pairof classes this but these two classes isthe search strategy just like in a stocksearch get your children pick somebodyfrom the open list now open this rightnow is that database and a specific pairof closets you pick from the databasetells you which mean you're progressingdo you see what I'm saying the search isslightly different search most of yourrules still apply here okay so under andyou will resolve C and C do let's getlet's say you get a new class c-1 - okayso for example if I see one happen to bethere we see to happen to be not be parC or D then C 1 2 would be a rc30you throw that into useful facts youwant to be an empty class sampe just getout of the loop and declare success okif it is not an empty class then youhave C what - to the database the newclass to the database andthese are insane and if you keep itTrottawhich how you are selecting the pair ofglasses here and you are considered alltypes of causes that can never beselected then basically you come out ofthe loop if you did find an empty classand if you did come out of the loop thenthat means you can get any big classanywhere that means that theorem is notprovableit's not anything you see what I'msaying now it's a beautiful point thisis the last time propositional logic isthe last time when you will have of themluckily possibly falling out theafternoon and seeing the theorem is notgood if you're doing the same thing forfirst-order logic in fact forfirst-order logic you know the one withthe fall there exists science that youmay have come across if you're doing itfor that everything what's almost thesame except the size of D in essencewill be infinitely large okay so thatmeans that you have to be it's apositive assertion that that basicallymeans that they never suppose will beinfinitely large because of which inessence you will never be able toexhaust all possible resolutions you maylock out and find the empty class eventhough you have infinitely large database you could be a lucky guy and youtake two classes which will give you alittle ass and you prove that there butif you're unlucky and your theorem isnot probable you have to exhaust thespace that's not possible for pastranalogic okay because of age for firstorder logic he basically confessed ourlogic inferenceis semi decidable in France apostolic isa by decidable if your theorem happensto be true then there will be somefinite set of the solutions you can doand get the in the class if you meansystemic if the theorem is false badluck that's allnow that you heard that romanticproposition logic means easy give medown because it's only go and becomplete it's only exponentially harderto run this process you know how do yoube happy about exponential part conceptfor semi decidable in front actuallyeverything looks good just like that Isaw the semester is going to look goodfor you okay so that's basically thereis the resolution our search searchengine solutionnow the question of course is what arethe strategies that you can use so theheuristics basically one idea would beto pick every possible pair of glassesso let's look at these pictures theselook kind of completely you know kindkind of incompressible but here is theidea you started with in this case thisis the brute force search you put allthe original clauses here that meansthat DC plus DG closets are popped inthis mmm site and then the first levelresolve Eames would essentially take twoclasses from the zeroth level andresolve it the second level resolve endswill take two classes at least one ofwhich is from the first level the thirdlevel solvent we take two closets atleast one of which is from the secondlevel if you do this you are going to beguaranteed that you never missed anyclasses agree this is why will you keeptrack of did I check everything rightyou know how exhausting space this isbasically what you would do if you justdirectly look at the search tree that 38that I put now that heuristics herewould be can I kind of not do some ofthe resolutions and still be able toguarantee that I will be able to do youunderstand it sent so one idea is calleda set of support strategy and what a setof support strategies say is is at everylevel you still have the secondarylexical etc but every level one of thepale of causes must be either the classthat came from the negation of the Bullsour class that came from the resolutionof one of those classes think about thisif in fact your knowledge base isconsistent to begin withand the theorem is true then the emptyclass has to come because the negationof the theorem has been added to theknowledge base do you see what I'msayingwhich means there should be a way ofessentially using the causes in the goalin the in your way to the empty class sowhat are you saying I only considerresolving a pair of causes if at leastone of the pair of causes has gone bloodjust like royal blood think of it thatway the cool part is it for all the coolprocess just like royal original RoyalAlbert and then anybody who came in fromthe Royals will have an argument that'sthe one of the classes should be goodblood classes the other can be any ofthe process if you do this you canclearly see that the number ofreservations are youis a strict subset is a proper subset ofthe total of resolution this get usagreed and the beautiful thing is youcan actually prove that this heuristicis complete that means every theoremthat was actually probable will beproven by each and every theorem thatcampthat's not attained you won't prove didyou see what I'm sayingthat's a beautiful heuristic so youessentially are doing less work now theinteresting question is you might bewondering well if this is the full treeand here you're doing fewer number ofresolutions and you're still sayingeverything is as well as the full treewhat gives what is changing but whatmight be changing is the number of stepsin the proof might be possibly longerthe number of steps in the proof mightbe possibly longerfrom your a-star search days that wouldmean the length of the solutionincreased that's not the optimalsolution but if you try to prove atheorem do you care how sharp the thingis no so here's a beautiful way ofnoticing that although we are talkingabout search just like a star searchwhat the differences are don't careabout solution linewe don't care about like the solutionright so there are different types ofheuristics not even it's a visibleI said complete the only thing you wantyou basically reduce the number ofresolutions and so you will get fasterthey're not that and yet you are able toprove exactly the theorems are provableno more no lessok so this is called a set of supportstrategy set of support you history thereason I can wanted to go into this isthe father cannot see to something thatyou are doing the reading of thesemester in Star Search with a slightlydifferent you know spin on it we doheuristics except if the solution lengthdoesn't matter then all you care aboutis if the previously you could find thesolution you should also be able to findthe solution now touch it that wasn'tenough for example a star search becausethey you want to find out the morelength solution so this is actually whatdo i thing to understand that the lengthof the proof we don't careactually this is beautiful since we'rehere since the people who do groups aremathematicians mathematicians doactually have a sort of aesthetics aboutwhat are good proofs and what are badfoods how many of you know I rushobviously you don'tso I already seen of course the KevinBacon of the nerdy said Ernest is thismathematician and the mathematicianessentially who lived out of hissuitcase they just come to some othermathematicians office and I'm going tobe here provided and let's put yoursuitcase in order start doing some sparkand so in fact one of the interestingthing about us is here because of whichhe has written papers with so many othermathematicians that and because he alsoa colorful character this notion ofothers number came into being arosehimself has others number zeroanybody who wrote a paper willbitterness has arose number oneanybody who wrote a paper with somebodywho wrote a paper
