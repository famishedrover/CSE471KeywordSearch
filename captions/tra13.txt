so a huge bunch of different approacheshave been invented for yearsokay different points in time you wantto be able to say 85% of the words whenthere was an alarm John will actuallycome so mostly what these kinds ofknowledge[Music]so okay so if your business can be donein multiple waysone idea is normal comic version in factMakati spend all his life coming up withthe name EDIlike he was trying to change normallogics to support this kind ofsituations to be able to do that whatyou need to say it is that I'm right andI fight like hours and I write a replyspeed I understood that this is alogical implication how issue is itdefault by default and in particular youcould think of it as you like if youwanted to kind of calm eyes and nothingyour mom let's say that's exactly whatyou be okay so you might have peace it'slike a hammer there then the car willstart the day when somebody comes andputs a potato in your tailpipe despiteno definition of the word novel rightyesso again my point is is not that you canthink of this room as and not my speedand then of course what happens is thisabnormality it's not a normal kind of aproposition it's basically it's aspecial kind of propositional specialkind of a predicate where if you areunable to prove abnormal then you canassume if you can't prove be you can'tjust find not be ok because we so justbecause you failed to a degree you canassume not easy but you know one way inwhich not monotonic logics workessentially is by writing these kinds ofpredicates like abnormal which will usewhat's called closed world assumptionthe assumption basically says it caneither be true or false so if I can'twait to be true then I'm going to bethis box you see what I'm saying andthen you find a trans find the proofthat is a problem in a small constant sohere is a great integrated reasoningquestion Fiji is about valid[Music]you know this is a useful understandthis is basically how you changelodgings such that they can supportdefault the reason okay so you're rightdefault rules and you try to in somesense minimize this is the idea of modelminimization you try to minimize thenumber of things that are abnormal inthe world okay and so unless provenotherwise you less youthese are not at all this isnon-monotonic logic why because when Isaid P is a burden to prove to yourselfthat myself it is an ostrich thisepisode reserves the reading with theline power then I said it's a magic thisis total wishy-washy logic in particularin passing commodity you prove a theoremit's true for time immemorial includinghow much ever additional knowledge youget you can't say things can change oneof these days I learned something I findthat one could be that's not there soclassical logic is called monotoniclucky because a theorem once proof willbe an upper class around your neckwhatever the physical our defaultreasoning is the art of seeing yes andthen say you know and then say yes andthen say you know and then we do thecorrections because people will sayyou're a flip-flopper it's your textingbut to which you should say is in adefault the world of default groups andbased on what we know we come to aconclusion and that when we know moreknowledge we need to be able to saywhere you belong and dealing with thatokay this is how humans actually whatnot politics even politicians work likethat except opponent has itso so this is happy defies example youcan do it both it's actually one ofcourse is vertex my sex or treaty if Itell you it is an ostrich bah-bah-bahthis now and you know you throw in thatabnormality that other way is usingprobabilities directly so you wouldwrite how many actually requireadditional probabilities so you mightconditional probability probabilitythree device even in the world is 0.99we have all words okay and poverty threedefies the word and if it is an ostrichis point four you notice of the evidenceincreased the probability reduced that'swhy you almost prove a theorem that you[Music]I cannot have this pop-up in which caseyou will be able to them even how youcan give a probability that we even if Iwhich is basically how we need it butthe point is I want you to think of whatwe do in properties from the context oflogic based on what I was saying eventhough this is like more or less obviousthing to do given that everybody hasdone probabilities even haveprobabilities in the community itselfthere was a huge push againstprobabilities okay so for example infact there was a push against magicand I stopped it he was smart enough torealize that other people who are dumbhow the scientists of the Philosopher'severybody who came before us but amberokay so we must stop things from scratchso we waited mice and triangle meals forquite a while before we started usingthe existing leaders okay so in 1977 forexample there was a paper in eachconference where somebody basically saidthey need to write a paper in defense ofmagic because people were using insteadof logic random stress which will nothave the semantics of life okay and thenby 1985 even eat the cheese man whenthis case of a saving magic probabilityago in fact pattern recognitionhe has a completely different idea thoseare the bozo who use numbers and thereal AI people will not use numberssuddenly not logically and thenbasically this was founded in 1985 witha cheese man who is both of this andyour chicken I'd like a paper rich guycome in defense of probability this youredge right nowyou should write in defense of prettymuch anything other than your ownnetworks and so much so that whatSantana said is those who is very smartpeople in 1977 did no logic is rightintroduced and in question so much sothat in fact this is a this is thereused to be back in nineteen nineties andthis textbook a sense of artificialintelligence completely 1993 andwhatever the textbook was written byback is vitam is the mathematicalphysics student he was a student ofPenroseand so before we go into four equalprobabilities between logic andprobabilities there was a finding therewere this whole time on expert systems[Music][Music]and then you do some kind of a proof youare multiplying divide numbers and thensay this is the certainty of my assetthis is what I'm using right now againyou're actually talking about magicsemantics I'm just saying this is youkind of a language and then when theytry to give semantics to it they fellflat and fits but then things areworking people don't ask for semanticsthen expert systems for working in factmy C which is the first medical expertsystem which started a huge AIIndustrial Revolution was usingcertainty practice and people said yeahit kind of works just the same wayyou're saying yeah you know it was akind of work theorems and theory ourBose was in the schools we care aboutindustry what we useokay so the problem of course certaintyfactors is that they are trying to doprobability into something like logic inparticular they're trying to make itwhat's got truth-functional that meanssomehow you should be able to computethe probability of something by just thenumbers involved in proving it justmultiply add the numbers I will tell youhow in fact the textbook has a chapteruncertainty factors you should read itjust so that you won't use it and it'svery very tempting much like the ideathe kind of idea you have about if Ibelieve it or not it's the end of ideathat people in every other area of gammafieldhow many also know how hard databaseshave you heard of things like functionaldependencies have you heard of thingslike approximate functional dependenciesfactual dependency words like other timeapproximate widgets are tough wordspeople try to model appropriatefunctional dependencies as a winningtactic so this was like a couple ofyears back so don't assume that peopleyou know just because something is noone you won it becomes common knowledgeto the human race okay so get intocircular busily okay imagine you havesomething like this they even employsgraphs will get better point much andthen if glass is said it was raining myrate might have happenedit's point seven nobody ever said thatthe rules have to be[Music]so you know[Music][Music]and there were all kind of fatter thanthis on the backthe pack started some industry Sundaywill make some moneyyou got this - and it looks as if youjust generalize logic without incurringany penalty because you can do whateveryou were doing before and then just doone ask or the proof and you will getthe correct numbers this you're insanehowever just like the certainty factorscan have circularity fuzzy logic andsome basic semantics proverbs basicsemantic problems one is for examplesuppose to tell you is point three thenwhat is a true the not tw20 second sothen what is the truth TW are not dowhat say so just like those guys wouldsay that's not the way you make math youshould not have it be looking over mathto see how the math is working just likethat's as dumpling idea as you know I'musing it peaceful music sometimes itseems to be greatI just check with its aquahama I willcome back here because checking orsomething is optimal is that have to dothe full search yourself to figure outwhat happens check if it is the same asthat solution that's a predefined iswhat I'm sayingokay so thesethis is equal to 0.7 but then how canthat make sense what exactly is it thatyou have drawn that you are happy withit okay now I think that these peoplewill still argue that so in fact one ofthe interesting things is I mean ofcourse just like 70 factors were used bymy sinsimilarly has been used by the Japanesewashing machines I mean anything thatmeans a silicon toolsI mean again I'm going out on a limbhere because every up there would befuzzy logic forces you can take thatMinister God you have promised and thatare a huge semantic problems which iswhy you almost never see okay now howmany of you completely realized that isthis still a friend of the sleeper is itdifferent from holistic youbut you're not apologies is this thesame wonderful thing about like you ifyou want to talk about poverty you putthings in a non-base needles so here'san arm full of white puppies and blackonyx diapers pockets and you normally dothe usual thing you close your eyes putyour hand I'm hoping that the puppydoesn't bite you okay right now how manyone two three four five sixbye puppies so I close my eyes I open myeyes I want to know what's theprobability that I'm holding back[Music][Music]but each of those so that's that what doyou think about the placement of thesetimes there is 715 number of times youhave seen a black car 613 you wouldnever have seen a problem which hashappened which is then essentially
