in the in my entire life I have doneright action in three three three timesokay and after three times here afterthat action I got two three two here Iwent to three do here I went to fourthree so the three times I went to fourthree one other times so based on thisexperience I would say my most maximumlikelihood estimate of this probabilityis 1 or 3 rightthat's it so you can do this for everypsas - my god the psst - are you that Inow have the TV now if I have atransition probability and thetransition matrix then I can solve V ofs equal to R of s plus sigma t SJ s -biagas - this was the policy evaluationfunction for the value equation thiswill give you a set of linear equationsyou saw them and you say I saw theequation of grab of just muck around inthe world that we use your booze okaymatter more is always better thanphysical work especially take it from mea great exercise but each actor ingeneral basically solving this thingmight look daunting but that's whatcomputers are part and living in theworld they have a good experience aregoing to be and are to be out of it inthis beautiful now I saw theokay now here is the interestingquestion then I have so basically indoing this in doing this I essentiallyam using the PI s the particular policythat amiability okaysuppose the dog wants to take controlsuppose Maggie in the backseat wants tostart driving Simpson Scott it hadenough it got that D balance I know thatit's supposed to just power the landcompute the value of the policy wants tojust find what the optimal action all itneeds to do is instead of solving thisit needs to sound R max of this once yougive me t it's like so the story I did Imention this year that Tesla has thesetwo cars one apparently as a long-rangeback for your other basically only goesfor like half a day or something andthen there was not Carolina was havingthese flights the other day you knowbasically they changed a couple of linesof code and told everybody in a Carolinanow all of your cars have the fullcapacity is for NC but because actuallythey have the same damn battery theyjust buy software they disabled it suchthat people wouldn't be enough money toalarm can't use it that's what it isthat's truewhat if you don't read any news you justcomeso you should buy the cheap Tesla andhave just like the iPhone break him theyshould be a Tesla breaking right andthen you make money so this is PS -telling me that you're only would youuse it to evaluate the policy is thatwhat gentlemen's agreement it's likeit's like a llama saying you paid lessmoney so whatever you do don't pressthis full battery option because thenyou get automatic and if you don't do itthen you're done so what I just did is Iwent from passive reinforcement learningto active reinforcement learning butmodel based so once I have the border Ican do either passive or activereinforcement learning a matter have thethree minutes so if I want to do if Iwere to have computed that transitionsremember that transitions themselvesthat the transitions that I looked inone form because I was sitting in theback of the car and my parents arerunning the policy and you yourself arefollowing the rules and only followingthe policy okay because of which it ispossible that you have not even seensome parts of the state spaceso it is true that you could do Batmanupdate there directly and get and youknow optimal action which is better thanjust following this policy but it's notgoing to be that truly optimal policybecause you may not have seen someescapes you never went there dependingon the actions you take you may not haveseen some parts of the worldokay so the idea that I had if youwant it just solve the optimal policy Ineed to guarantee you that every spiritthat can be reached has been experiencedthat is the idea of exploration beforeyou set it downyou must have exploded the entire statespace only then will you know whetherthe policy that you came up with isoptimal truly in every normal agentslives like your life there is this hugetrade off between exploration andexploitation this is one of this trulydeep trade offs that everybodyexperienced how long the people who keepbosses spot music will again usegraduate students and I will say thatgraduate students are more intoexploration if you after the you knowhigh school when you said enough ofstudying the world words then you justexploit this you will get jobs typicallyof the bargain flipping variety youexplore more and do PhD you might getbetter jobs are you my time by doing Xmuchthat's what radar which is rotten seaexploration of exploitation trade offdifferent people solve it in differentways black students explore longer and Ikeep making fun that's who we hangaround in school I never left spoonnever I'm the happiest person soultimately the question is how much ashow do I get expression so in thisparticular example what happened was ifI'm just following this policy in thestates that I know I will never have tothose tapes because unbeknownst to me ifI do this action I am either stay herenot come here if I do this action here Iwill go outside on the side of stay herethese are Beach me I have a blind spotthe blind spot that you have you don'tknow the states of the worldyou haven't seen you don't know thatstudy is amazing you have tried itit may help with like the most amazing[Music]
