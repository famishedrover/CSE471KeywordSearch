despite the fact that this one looks asif she has a life computers don't havemy and basically he can just work withindividuals model what they figure outthe technology correctly model what theyhave learned what they haven't you knowdon't just kind of teach to you so Iunderstand that and so I'm basicallytelling you that since there is no clearway you would know which of the 150people I am aiming my corset I'm justtelling you this is what I'm aiming atand if you're too far away from thisthen you know you probably might be Ishould also mention that in general justfor myself I don't feel particularlyproud of it but for myself a smartperson being bored in the class is morenegative to me than a struggling personfalling behind I'm not proud of it butI'm telling you what it is okay and sofor the second part I make sure thatthere are many minute years many manyoutside class ways in which you can comeup to speed but I want to make sure thatnobody gets bored here especially okayeffort you're forbidden from crawlingthe web for answers code etc no I'm notlooking for people who are so round outof under the lock just this morning thatthey don't know that for any course thatcan be asked in any question that can beasked in an interview I of course thereare 15 sites giving you the answers butyou know I know you know and you shouldknow that I know that okay first of allI is not being gradedthat you can shoot cheat and choosingnot to do you understand pleaseunderstand this ticket is that knowingthat you can cheat and choosing not andI hope you all have integrity I justassume blanketly right now all of youare honorableI'm not going to play the policeman Ididn't take up this job to be apoliceman I'm very bad for this man inmultiple ways including if you getcaught you don't want to be caught by meokay so the expectation is that I startwith a prior assumption that you are allhonourable any infraction however willbe dealt withSeverus terms allowed because I'm sayingthis it's being recorded so I have it onthe record that I've already told youyou don't have to say oh I didn't knowthat I'm suppose not to cheat here everyother class I get to cheat now that'snot going to happen okay you shouldassume that you know the usual waystudents cheat and we'll check forcourse we are teaching a idea prettyintelligent folks others okay and wehave mass and we have a I take twotechniques that we'll be using that youdon't know of that will check whether ornot your cap you know is calligraphyokay but we are basically those areautomatic things most of the time I'lljust assume everybody is there to learneverybody is here to just okay anyquestions on this I'm not ever againgoing to talk about unfold in this classthis is supposed to be miss you okay Imean the class what I would love to dois in in a Harvey Mudd College they havea honor code and once you sign the honorcode you can take timed exams in yourdamn room that's what honor andintegrity means so people will basicallyjust put a line right as as soon as thetime is over they put a line and saywait on it okayI think we can do that I mean everybodyis in it's not that it's not like havinghigh IQ being honorable doesn't requirehigh IQokay so let's all be honoredany questions on this okaythen we are going to do an introductionsupposeOhso you notice that so you'll notice thatany slides I give from my recent talkswould be the nice landscape slides butany slides I do for the class would bethe old for whites these slides becauseI've been doing this course for a longenough time that I keep changing themadd more slides etc they still continueto be in further so this one that wasmore recent ones so notice that I eatthis interaction put on board with 2001Space Odyssey by the way how many of youhave seen 2001 Space Odyssey one of thedesktop you doing essentially why areyou even taking in intercourse aroundotherI'm seriously it's very more interestingin some ways than ex machina okayinfluence everybody in the eyes sopeople ask you ask anybody in the eyeyou know the guys what's the most whatis like one of the movies that you knowinfluenced you most Duvall mentionedit's a crazy movie honestly if youactually haven't read the book the moviedoesn't make sense up front but it'ssuddenly what you know seeing it yeah sothe point that I dig that introductionand it's not that 2014 if you noticed itactually stopped with the 2014 slidebasically I as a discipline has beenaround for quite a long time this was myundergraduate thesis in speechrecognitionyou notice that laser printers weren'tinvented and that's my handwritten opticchips and so onand then I was very attracted studymostly the I was for suckersyou know people basically everybodywould be kind of snickering away sayingyou know why don't you do something moreexciting okay so that's the weights beamand what's worse by nobody see asoftware utility can't be done I'mdatabases can't be done about themstands respectable physicists like RogerPenrose yes a field has had a criticalproblem with mathematical physiciststhat we will see in a minute becauseStephen Hawking hasn't been particularlynice to itbut Roger Penrose for example wouldwrite a bunch of books like no no thisis just the whole thing is not possiblehey I can't get up so we just prove atheorem upfrontokay and there is no game of course butit's a physicist so you have largenumber of mathematical symbols at anyrate and so as an object as a graduatestudent trying to do a thesis in the eyewhere before you were probably some ofyour parents were born in 1984 timeframeah the reception we had essentially forit was these kinds of things whatcomputers still can't do what isemperor's new mind by AI is not evenpossible this is whole entire thingabout Chinese room there's actually inthe textbook there is a a I andphilosophy section it's worth readingabout as to what does it mean to saysome understanding has been achievedokay so these orders were gone um andthen you know things were going alonglong enough that actually when I wasteaching this course I had to make thatparticular drink bhang interactionbecause it wasn't like you people whoare walking the house to take in debrisI you are busy taking you are your peersin those days we're taking softwareengineering for dice and so now ofcourse we can stop you from coming inbecause they're just people you knowtrying toapplause but some extra actually I thinkthe tipping point is where that lasts upexcept endedsniffing hacking and everybody'sfavorite car manufacturer Elon Muskessentially one day woke up and said thebiggest worry for Humanity is AI okayand no you know that from the day oneeven before this place were bornHollywood has been telling you thatrobots are basically out there to killus there is no other reason why robotsthat we're okay and so they've beentelling you this the only difference isnow you have times also tells you thisnow every other you know news articlealso basically tells you the eyes orforget you so that's the scream that washeard across general population about ohmy god he is kind of good to be a badasssalivating so Moscone Bosnia and aHawking arch ban on warfare and yeah Ian autonomous weapons he is going tocause huge technological unemploymentNetflix Reed Hastings basically said thebattle for Earth will be between highmachines and digitally modified humansI don't know how their movies are goingto be a Netflix then of course StephanHawking in back in 2016 self and ofcourse by the way I assume you know thatyou go under therebut he says the key to saving humanitywill be colonizing other planets reallyno maths and all that but he felt it'stoo late already so robots are out toget you before you even get away to meetthe planets so those of you who saidyou're taking this course to figure outhow to stop the robots were on the righttrack because anyway space travel isoperatingright here okay um okay so this guy isOscar Wilde pretty sure I did say thisOscar Wilde said listen if you want toreport me to your local patrioticcommittee please remember right acrossthis guy who said that America's theonly country that went from barbarism /decadence without civilization inbetween he is like full of these kindsof criticisms he's like you know life ofthe party at the end of the party thenwe team up so he said this and I wouldthink you know is it true that er is AIpossibly the only technology that wentfrom full disappointment which is formost of my career directly to doomsdaywhat isn't working it is important it isworking oh my god where is the middlewhere is the good times that databasepeople except ahead so this is what I'mspeaking and so what I'm going to do inthe time that I have today just happenedso what happened of course is this hugehype is not only bigger than you cansuppose it's bigger than two camerassuppose so this is actually a play onsomething that biologists jps Hal downonce said by the way this is the otherthing this class will be full ofreferences just full of references andif you pick up all those references itmight be useful especially Seinfeld ifyou have time watch Seinfeld seem somepower will happen okay but heavy as helldown is this biologist and he said theuniverse is not only clear but it isclearer thanyou can suppose it's we don't even knowhow strange they're us this is whatyou're saying and I think that's not atrue for a I do it is not only biggerthan you suppose it's bigger than youcan suppose you all heard about thesekinds of things how many have you notheard that AI is the new electricity youhave heard on your hovered you have ifyou haven't heard you know you can youknow connect you already has system newplugs or something and apparently fanswill runyeah that's what I'm doing said sundarPichai who is the Google head basicallywanted to go on about him and saidexactlyhe discovered God and he said yeah he'sgot okay every possible random industrywants to see it they have Iranian it heis bigger than what chain by the wayremember that you are company for doingmaybe the caskets or something saidblockchain cascades and it's talked youup before people thought it makes nosense okay company and is not doing wellsay we're doing a I so one of this onething that I like is you cowl gate smartelectronic toothbrush okay this isdesigned with a oddities and uses AIalgorithms to detect a brushingentertainers in 16 phones of the smartbrushtotally smart - okay I don't know Iwould never use it particular cubiclebees okay so this is the level of youknow positive hyper courtyard thenegative hyperopia is a is bigger threatthan not aquaria yeah I will stop thethird world warokay that's what according to a longmass the I could be the worst event inthe history of civilization itselfStephen Hawking and must comes back tothe rescue C again C is highly highlylikely to despite a strike unless linksucceeds and we become one with okay soI'd like to say so I also have a Twitteraccount mostly do this kind of nonsenseon the side the market for AI expertswithout any AI background has never beengreaterokay so because if you know here youmight actually attempt or what you aresaying you know alarm is not the worstof them there are random peopleessentially everybody is an act but nowokay so it's like extremely hard to tellif anybody knows anything about anythingokay suddenly the visionhe has pretty impressive stuff includingof course buying over the I am giving itand also starting neural link etceterabut does he understand AI hieratic thelimits etc I would not think so okay butI have okay so now you know obviously weare in academia we are always beating sowe take this more you know long-termview we don't just go with the flow wedon't go with crazy hypes so because ofwhich what is a man what is Academy aredoing MIT is planning a college forartificial intelligence how many of youwho know this Schwartzman College an AIis going to be started with aboutbillion dollars it's going to be at thesame level as a college of engineeringscrew computer fileswho cares about Tonka design it's biggerthan engineering okay yeah it's biggerthan anything you can think of okayTandon even on launches an undergraduatedegree in AI siren wails high school AItextbook undergrad is too late[Music]yeahIndia introduces ya into 8th 9th and10th rates thankfully we are in ESUwe know all of this is too little andtoo late so I and my colleagues havestarted this unit Indiaprogram unborn because they should comeinto this damn worldhyper-competitive because okay and ofcourse I'm not complaining you know it'slike nobody used to care what I wasdoing now alakazam I'll hang out in instudios there's a Bill Nye episode inNetflix that features me I don't have aWikipedia page unless one of you make itbut I have an IMDB pageokay and then of course I got to go andbeat before in India I also got to go toWhite House to meet with various peopleso many of these things happen duringthe time I happen to be the president ofAssociation for advancement ofartificial intelligence particular I andso like our own norm leader I takecredit for everything that happens inaviation so I made the I great again iswhat I think so I do have thatparticular cap so you can find it sowhat I want to say right 15 minutesactually is a little more about whathappened and maybe you probably this isthe ethical impactor so on let's see sowhat is the average spend more timetalking about it next class butessentially informally and it's for youguys it's getting machines to do thingsthat when done by humans would beconsidered intelligent behavior whichlooked like a great explanation for yeahI accept a highly circular first of alland secondly is actually going to bequite biased because have you ever saidto your friend why you're so intelligentyou realize this is a typo can as anaverage can you never said that did youever say wow you're so intelligent yousee this as a cat did you say that noyou only seem to say that theseintelligent she is intelligent if theyare dumb chests well if they have donesome go well if you are readythe location countries but somehow wehave very specific views of whatintelligence is when we are asked to sayso this has good as it looks like adefinition it's actually a questionabledefinition but technically it really isdesigning intelligent agents that's whatwe will talk about in this course andfiguring out what is the architecture ofthe intelligent agents is mostly what iscourse is going to be the team Tarawayou can keep in mind in terms ofunderstanding the bigger arc of AI isthis picture that if you compareessentially the way human kids startshowing what we consider ok a kid youare all kids at one point of time butyou also promised our kids little kidswhen they come into this world theystart showing perceptual abilities theycan see you know mom's face dad's faceand smile again ok kids who don't dothat basically don't exist because theynever got any affection and then theycan manipulate things not just peoplebut also objects take everything and putinto their boxes the most importantthing to do so here is a little kidwho's actually trying to take one sprayone day and calm lunch with her familythis kid was taking every little thingon the lunch table very explicitlymanipulating them and then the mom butthere are no robots that can do thisright now that level of fine motion wejust don't have cars here ok but kids dothis the image recognition hand-eyecoordination these are things that arelargely tacit and subconscious we dothis if somebody asks you how do you dothis you have no ideaok so in fact to get that intoperspective so this is kind of tacitknowledge to get the difference betweentacit and explicit knowledge intoperspectiveremember Coursera it exists still at onepoint of time it looked asto take over the world which could havemattered to you your only students butfor me that's a job security issue rightof course then I was teaching all thecourses what am i doing okayso I was very quickly trying to become aswimming instructor do you understandwhyhas anybody learnt swimming by watchingvideoseverybody here launched deep learning bywatching videos calculus by watchingvideos swimming not so good do you seewhat I'm sayingthere are tacit knowledge which isbasically you almost have to be towardsort of by hand rather than readingtextbooks but you know at the same timethat human civilization has written tonsand tons of books there are very fewswimming books there are books aboutswimming how people look if they areswimming how they will bring me in theswimming you read those books you gointo the swimming pool you sink like astorm okaythat's the tacit knowledge they don'tget emotional intelligence they startshowing emotions and recognizingemotional responses that's a veryinteresting question as to why we havethis is what that happens then we starthaving social and communicativeintelligence they know how to get alongwith other kids and they know how totalk to other kids okayeither by gestures are by naturallanguage which only we have animalsdon't have notice this stuff animalshave it's true that your dog isn't ableto explicitly take stuff from the Ithink because it doesn't have a fivefingered hand but it's quite exquisitein the things that it can do in terms ofphysical managers in offense can dolarge numbers of amazing things theyhave this nice big trunk I wish I hadone you can use by definition for smallso this stuff animals have this alsoanimals have we know emotional supportanimals are never humans you understandyou try saying you know my body is myemotional support and then I bring themwhy don't we do this you must knowsupport animals or animals okay and thenhave emotional support and social willcommunicates intelligence is is theplace where humans start bickeringdifferent we have that at animal storyokay um and then finally we go tocognitive or visible intelligence thestuff that we seem to get tested on inyour SATs and I'm Dino taking exams onall that stuff this is almost the lastthing that kids get some of you areprobably still not ready yet for thatokaybut that's the other approximately weseem to show you must now if you look atthe eyes progress towards intelligencethis is not the first time if youremember the five-minute video in thebeginning it didn't start in 2088 infact it ended in 2014 there are a wholebunch of things that we had was by thattime already pretty present ok the kindsof things that were pretty impressiveand and led to all sorts of hype arounda I'll include these people expertsystems in 1980s which were good forexplicit knowledge if your company hascertain rules that it follows to makedecisions you know rather than havesomebody read these rules and look atall the interaction between the rulesand come up with the decision you canautomate this such expert systems and sothe huge thing in 1985 internationaljoint conference on AI was held in LosAngeles and the opening reception had tobe held in the zoo not because heactually plot animals but because thatwas the only place that could fiteverybody okay in 1985 that was the lastprevious bubble for air in our 90s therewere reasoning systems we had a chestdeep blue which one over Kasparov andbasically everybody was thinking thatthis is the end of everythingetc but then somehow this moved ononly even at a time when they were doingthat they were the beating casparothey didn't have the ability to themachines didn't have the ability torecognize pieces or old pieces if on theother hand you get your 1 year old nieceand nephew in front of a chessboard theywill hold each of the piece verycarefully and put it in their mouth butthey have no clue what is a checkmateare what upon does they think everythingis for eating they are good at actuallythat recognition and manipulation that'sthe thing that was missing in the oldchess programs for example we were ableto do chest without doing any perceptionon manipulation in some weird sensehonestly he put cognitive intelligenceon a high pedestal I mean if you thinkof Stephen Hawkinghe's like the paragon of cognitiveintelligence the guy can't what he can'tspeak he just barely sees and he wasable to change the world by thinkingabout how you know that here is that'swhat breed as humans that's what weconsidered the most important thingright um it's only 2003 started actuallyI started to the perceptual testthat's the stuff by the way all of youare here for because your cell phonescan say this is your picture this isyour friends picture you can talk toyour cell phone it can do voicerecognition you know these perceptualintelligence is the most recentphenomenon if you did have this and ifyou could rent two-year-olds I don'tknow whether it's allowed but if you canrent it to be the rolls I'm sorry theywould be doing that for youthey can do perception they can domanipulation they'll put everything intheir mouth but you know they can domanipulation but it's important to keepthis in mind ok it's not obvious you areall basicallyokay yes generally again please pleasedon't take it back with anybody who saysomething might be long and so I willsay there I'm on and so you are get tosay AHA that is poor and you know I wishI did ski is a closed mouth gathers noreserves but the reality is using thisparticular observation I will say thatif ever you ever tend to explainsomething by saying this stuff ismathematical you are not on the rightpatheverything is mathematical it's justdifferent math everything ismathematical do you see what I'm sayingso that's not a good way it's areasonable thinglots of people keep them that way buttry not to think in those kinds ofthings because they're particularly notparticularly useful yes pleaseso you're testing they're doing peoplemaybe last in first up whatever be theirlast to get I'll just tell you that theother stuff I already forgotten I don'tremember it's an interesting observationbut unfortunately doesn't make too muchsense like yes yes so I'm going to endwith this slide but this slide mighttake some time so hopefully we will andvery close to 45 but let me completethis like we say you run away okay oh Ithink the fact that AI systems let thisway we're humans this way if youunderstandit explains even trying to explain it toyourself is actually a useful phenomenaso my explanation of rules is that it iseasier to program computers and aspectsof intelligence for which we haveconscious theories did you hear thisproverb that serious I see I kind ofunderstand I do I understand more andthen the next thing is I teach I reallyunderstand and the fourth thing is Iprogram I really really reallyunderstand right your heart is beforeyou came herewhat are you understanding because youhave a theory for how to do it and youare trying to put it in a program formwe had conscious theories whether theirfeet are reasonable we had conscioustheories for most of our cognitiveintelligence tasks we have zero tensiontheories about how perception works ourmanipulation works they used to be anarea called computer vision and a lot ofyou want to get into it it's become asubroutine for machine
