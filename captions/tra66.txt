[Music]unless you are following this section onPiazza you know that project managingassignment that some people already aregone those of you who are done with theproject is a it post anonymously maybeis knowing rest of the class might takeit up value your time so I so if youhave any questions about I'm alreadydown and about to upload the project andsince I'm working this is not the thingthat you want to compute me as astrictly right there is a way of postinganonymously they give me my own name forthe rest of the people might be rathermad at people who get done earlywe know your name so it's just a usefulthing to keep in mind the other thing issomebody was asking if we will use upthen we do have a canvas set up you canall be used canvas atomic who guess meso you can see your grades even that wemighteverything else about this boss he'sgoing to need without saga Q Street okayI understand that you might be usefulcanvas in a particular way in otherclasses but there's some humongousamount come on about four years weobserve in terms of the open hundreddiscussions that it allows and impactfederal but the canvas actually hasacknowledged that the one report embersblackboard really suck and so that's whyI secret to Piazza but you know heanswered you can actually write logiccode directly and you get my scene thenthey are limited so you can askquestions okay so that's the thing aboutcanvas is a temporary goit's the comment so get useful that'sthat so what you did it is veryimportant for us in multiple waysbecause actually a very well connectedin your project 1 1 as well as part twoand the second musica this is a givesyou a sense of the kind of understandingthat we buy the levy as we go forwardfor example we talked about you knowunderstand how much have search isactually up tomorrow and we have someto understand why wait admissibleheuristic actually comes from andrealize that they come from axe factionsand will give variety of examples ofderiving heuristics for differentproblems in your project you would haveto be deriving some additional andeffectively mistakes for your ownproblems and so why I want some aproblem here you should give you an ideaas to where it's come from and what is Itry to get get to understand is that youderive jurisdiction over self byabstracting details of a problemremember at the very end of last class Ipointed out that if I wanted to movesomewhere even though the exact shortestpath might be hard to compute because ofall the obstacles I can always abstractaway all the constraints and then justsay all the chains disappear now thatpeople disappearat which point is basically free spaceexcept me and the other person and thenI know what the real garbage in that arevery cheap problem that's an abstractedproblem you know what the optimal pathis that's just that's just a eitherdistance that's you know a tiny sphereokay but having said that it's importantto understand that not every realistichas to have a simple closed-formsolution that gets in value in constanttime in fact an abstract version of theproblem might well be still quite hardand this is something that you have tounderstand in fact you do value in thesecond part of the first project theobvious unity won't get you as good aperformance as once where you actuallycome out thinking in terms of slightlyharder to compute mistakes whichnevertheless helpon the food and by the give youintuition as to why that will happen sothat you are not surprised about thatpackage ethics but it's important tounderstand and not be bias that aheuristic must be something that's liketo life cycle it doesn't helpit's just a solution for an abstractquestion of the current problem and themore abstract the effect more of theabstraction I have the less useful theunit stickers because it's too far awayfrom reality whereas if I the less ofabstraction I have the asked me aboutyou to speak would be it's pretty muchas hard as you knock off because you'releaving a few constraints okay so thereis this fundamental research field andthen we talk about ideas for which I sawyou today last time by looking at ID yousee that is deepening means one personis here and then we just go where I meanyou see a saluted G very basic arcs andthus far ok whatever thing I would sayyou in the past is one of the thingsthat you have to understand is that youwould speak estimate that we dotelegraphic in this for example you knowright so what we try to do is we try tosay when I read B I need to have a anestimate of how far we is to the closestball node okay if I want the exact valueI can start from V and do that firstsearch of a uniform cost search and thatwill give me give me the t1 passed tothe book but I want to have an estimateokay now as I said estimatesgood estimates come some abstractionsome of the problems but when I wrotethis I just put up some numbers like Iput up like for example 23 and I put avery numbers which is according to therealistic estimate and in general whatthat means as we go forward we realizethat QT speaks me not how physicalsignificance it will be coming out ofthin air because of village although herespects our mainly distancesthe best way to think of it is makingits estimate of the distance will be onthe processbook right although they aresupposed to be estimates of distancesthey may not have all the propertiesdistances have what is the good propertya distance metric has for exampledistance that should be positivethat's it is another property what otherproperties will know about distancematrix yes symmetry is a potential pointin fact that's a useful property butthat may not actually hold a burdenright I need to be able to go from A toB but I don't the task of going tonightwill be doesn't have to be the past I'mgoing for me today so symmetry may nothave to go the other one but he said howmany of you heard of triangularinequality that's a very important oftenoverlooked property of a distance whatdoes the kymograph inequality say itsays something very simple in a triangleOh if you add up the lengths of any twosides any two sides now some better bemore than the third side more than orequal to when it is equal it is atriangle which happens to be a scraperwhen it is less I don't know otheraccurate argument it's not a distance soone worry is if I'm making a heuristicnumber for each of these what is thissometimes they may not actually satisfytriangle inequality if they don'tsatisfy them then the underlying searchstarts behaving funny me it will stillreach the optimum according to that ismaybe that mystical but you could dounnecessary work which is why in thetextbook that you then we have this ideaof the path maxcorrection so if ever the heuristichappens not to be following behind alogical equality then it won't beconsistent units take and you can makeit consistent by changing the estimatesthese are just estimates is what I'msaying I will repeat this you know withrespect to it it's useful to know thesethings that's what we're going to dohere remembering what we did last timeessentially we know that there is anoptimal paths are going from D to G D wewill just call it h star be the perfectto display the optimal cost of goingfrom village if you want to compute thatI'm going to pass that as costly as theoriginal search so it better be you wantto compute it cheaper so instead youwant to estimate that distance theestimates can be wrongthe problem with estimates are that theycould be wrong they could be not onlytwo different ways because these arereal numbersone is distance okay and it's very easyto understand that if you want the UHturbine search to reach optimal solutionyou better stick to the Bolognaadvantage below that perfect thatperfect Ustica[Music]so imagine you give HSN to be infinityfor other nodesthat's what other carbon gets whathappens then you would be the happiestguy your search algorithm will completelike lightning fast right you say spotit says moderation[Music]it's not saying because everything isinfinite so no solution you're notimmediately you would be able to come upwith four examples whether are actuallysolutions and your algorithm is going tosay no solution forget about the moneyit's not even complete you see what I'msayingit's not even company okso that property of a heuristic alwaysbeing less than the optimal value whichyou don't know what it is is called theproperty of a miscibility and the beautyis but the visibility property shouldhold for every possible node so thatyou're asleep would becomes very visiblein fact every search mode its estimateof cost to the process goal is how willthe rover bomb it's not enough money tobe correct for a few or not correct forhours only if it missing pretty is a funall property every node every search onevery aspect of the village must havethe heuristic value which is lower boundof the past to go to the actual cost togo to the process okay that is true canyou guarantee that a star search will beactive okay and if for example if thiswas like a mammal search in the planewith the kind of thing I was talkingabout trying to be somebody at end ofthe room or something then for is youknow that straight-line distance is thelower bound it's the shortest distancebetween any two points on the planehow do you know that because I alreadyproved that okay in general abstractionswill have this property okay and that'show we will get with these kinds ofheuristics now interesting question soyou know that here is its star and let'ssay and then we know that this side is abad side because if you go this side noproperties hold you know that if you arelessthen it'd start a family this is lessthan or equal to this is greater thanequal and the less than or equal to sideclearly it is a musical so that thequestion of course is if you get to haveone H 1 here and 1 H 2 here both of themare less damaged - which would be betterHT h 2 battle because it will give abetter optimal solution H 2 betterbecause actually will give a betteroptimal solution that's a stupidquestion to ask there is no betteroptimal solution there is just optimalsolution this happen say equal cost soreally both H 1 and H 2 are going togive you the optimal costit's that H 2 will get done faster it'sexpanding the number of nodes expandedlet's get one moreexecution straight in fact in fact ifyou got H star for every node they giveyou the actual distance level how manynodes do you think the search willexpand in that case it's optimal so youstill good enough resolution rememberyou don't know somewhere in here is theoptimal solution that the actualsolution would I am giving you eightstar you know the only numbers we have aB which is a branching factor D which isa depth my question is how many nodes interms of B and D would you be expandingif I give you H starthis is nice because you can mumble andB and D are extremely right B hasn'tdepth because it's top will always tellyou that I know to expand the next noteexpand that note that fun until yourestart one go if the optimum goal is ataxi pleasethen you would do exactly theexpansion's that's the best so this topsearch will do in the best case numberof expansions how many expansions willit do in the worst case why is it Bpower D because our search isunfortunately a really bad is our searchnow you forget how to get someproperties of a star search number thatuniform first search is the black sheepof the familyokay and it is basically H equal to zeroand you know you come by such a blindsearch it has B power D expansions soessa' goes somewhere between two notesof expansion dependencies that if you'rerealistic in is you know is bounded byat most be like epsilon away it's onetimes away from the optimum distancethen it will do V power epsilon T soit's still exponential it's just asmaller exponentokay it's one will become zero only whenin fact you will wind up having aperfect solutionespecially lately is this out there thisis a search I just use one slide and Ihope you backed out there is really nomagic you know you obviously have youtest them because it is greater than ifI'm going to get you a lot to be greaterthan you put infinity and then use it intopicyou sure what I'm saying and we do knowthat somebody would is less thanactually is optimum because uniformclass search is our black sheet and thatKH equal to 0 and H equal to 0 zombieless than H at India Japan that'soptimal so you know the good side isthat we bless them okay so in particularof course you know on these numbers afamily and a star search uses admire itusing a physical newspaper Japan is lessthan or equal to 8 elephants andremember it's fr all M any good can youhave asked me Chen it's for all K forevery search node hmm for that searchnode has to be less than H then it isconsidered decreasing only then are youguaranteed to be optimum do you see whatI'm saying suppose I want to say so theimportant thing to the other side isthen I say we have a miscibility purestate you are guaranteed yeah thatdoesn't mean that if you have ainadmissible heuristics you areguaranteed to be in optimal did youunderstand what I just said ok it'sbasically like if you are if you aredark you will have an accident you'renot drunk you can still have an accidentokay so basically the roof is only thatif it is admissible guaranteed to beoptimal it's not admissible maybe it isoptimal and as I told you and I hope youremember very clearly maybe is optimalis as useless as I have no idea becauseif I say maybe it's optimal oh you haveto check for a bodhisattva vow in whichis your booth and that such optimalityshould be that be guaranteed and youjust say I give up I'm a loserthere is no me guess I can accept acceptall that said we are thinking about itexcept since you are this question ofgoodness that and our answer gee youcould have come to the same node in twodifferent directions in a graph searchand that state will wind up having twodifferent G values H star is onlyconnected to the optimum we have I meanrepresented that then in that situationsubstitute yes except finding that Gvalue you got G by doing such nobodytold youNords don't have G value until you reachthem you need search to get the value ofthese are by they're extremely goodquestions if you try to understand thatwhether you should have suspicions okayG values are not given out the thingsthat are given to you at the edge cost Cand one attempted and H values HR anyknown G values are found during thesearchso you're right except to find you nowwe undo the search which gives up whichkind of kills the whole point[Music]let's follow all of my arguments rightnow okay you will get that okay so so webasically are doing drive-bys searchwith a pop and equal to G of M plus h Fwithin each other and for all n is lessthan or equal to H for attack okay umnow the question is it turns out Ialready kind of gave you math here proofbut our case please like other case thesite on this side at least one blackshape which seems to be optimal on thisside is definitely on that key whichwill become it so if you have to pickwhich goods which is the good side thisis looking side that's not even truethat's the way to get the intuition solet's do theokay let's undo this and let me go slowand see if you can get under the nextpage actually have the proof so imagineyou start with an ignoramusn0 right and what we will do is we willdo something called use by contradictionokay and so what I do is n 0 and at somepoint of time you know under the F thatsearch mode there is a a search node andthat the search after them picked up forexpansion and it's gold tested hittingand is a goand so it stopped and it said this pathand 0 to M is the optimal path and handin stock okayyour body if this is optimum that meansessentially the key event is the optimalamong all the doorswhat if I what now I'll try to basicallysay maybe the time if I basically willtry to argue but no no there is this end- I mean assert okay that there is a nun- such that and that should actuallybetter than everwhat does better mean for us it meansgia and - not as I'm reporter is here itis strictly less than G okay right okayit's strictly less than the other thisis my claim all you need to do in aproof by contradiction is to say thatthisso so so this is how you're one rightthat's possible however given thestructure of search list you'd better bethe case that there is some and doubledash which is an ancestor search timeancestor of an - which was under a longright okay so is essentially that thisis not going to be true okayand the argument goes essentially thatif I have so at the time you have openlist on the list - okay and I am saneand at the time they both together atthat time it must be the case that F ofn is less than or equal to F of n double- this must be - otherwise - somehow andour - - n - the inequality changed doyou see what I'm saying so what we aresaying is and the complete path to thenode n complete path to the node n thennode n is the goal node remember becausecomplete part of the role of all n nodeand so and both that you have on handwas already lower cost than a partialpart ok the partial path which is what'snow become better than what youcurrently have as good for that tohappen in the case of uniform personwhether it is same exact few words foruniform pasturage parsesin stuff f you ended up in depth of justG values for your investment in theuniform percentile argument would behaveit just are never negativeso if you are already if you're partialpodcast is already more than somebody'sreal goal cast then you are a loser youwill never get better than other yesthat's the proof of optimality ofuniform a search that won't be enoughfor esta because what you are looking atis essentially you need to the templedouble dash is I have got half of thatdoesn't necessarily mean that GN doubledash is already higher than
