like to swap clothes and somebody fromthe second tomorrow unless you want meto ride in the cap yes[Music]- how distant the okay so what thatelement you seeit's no right here okay if you do notknow how far you are from here to acorner then you are considered anempowerment search is what I'm sayingso if you have no idea how far you haveleft to go then you are considered anonion power research okay for the otherhand you don't know how far you've comethen you are considered a brainlesssearch I nobody can help you if youdon't even keep track of all of you whatokay if you don't know how much you haveto gothat's it is another question if youdon't even pay attention to how longwe've been walking nobody can help youokayso this because when you think of actingmy uniform cost search right if youthink of something like a fun car searchwhich might have made a very bad namebecause we will focus on the first two asecond where do the edges havenon-uniform cosyou shouldand keep the case of local searchstrategies all you're doing is where youare you don't even know how far you havejust you know okay[Music]which is what we will be discussingbefore we get into continuous there aretwo kids in town and systematic what islocal search and in the case of that wejust know when you are in the caresystem and if you know how you got towhere you are because how pointless allthe way to the beginning of the searchthere is a search team it's the searchtree that makes you we discipline itmakes you not go back to the same placeagainokay here and the foul is calledokay and so in fact and then there isthis issue of how far do you think youare come here to the ball not this spothow far have traveled you should knowexactly if you have visiting in Swift'syou know how far your memory this on theother hand is in ischemia okay andthat's called each other that's what youread about and so the question of courseis how do you get good estimates forthis instead of talking about G and Hyou basically are in a particular placeacross in which direction which are myneighbors should I transition to whichare my neighboring points neighboringsearch console a transition and so if Imean you talk about you Linna how offyour neighbors are and you end up keepthem and put this function how wouldargue that as good the ones that arecloser to the goal will have highergoodness okay and then you pick the onewhich is the best neighbor the one whichis the most promising neighbor isactually where the points are notdisplay yeah contiguous space so thequestion then is which eventuallyrespectspace should I make a small step theword small bow is not going to find asmall a schmuckokay but assuming that we're going tomake a very small step then whichdirection should you make that step inand that's where you know we'll get tothat and you probably have someintuitions of your calculus essentiallysince most of a continuous searchalgorithms will tend to be basicallylooking for the minima of the maximum ofa function so their solution s isdefined in terms of nygma's and Max mustthey will just essentially look towardsthe direction of the gradient in thedirection so gradient is essentiallytelling you goodness function of thedifferent directions then set of tacticsdirections and you're justthere isn't any reasonable sense theonly way you can have there are finitenumber of regions and you are thenactually searching in that so space isinfinite very much an example of this infact everything you learned in the endof lectures is an example of asystematic search in fact if you want tomove any property of any algorithm itmust be a systematic search give us zerouseful property into a new set of themhas no properties even though to get toany minima let alone a global minima youunderstand what I'm saying if you wantto have the optimal solution the onlytime don't have searched out therethere's wind up having such propertieswould be very very few cases thenthere's some beautiful structure to thespace in fact we will see an examplewhen we get to mark rotation processesvalue iteration and these are theseideas are fixed[Music]okay so you get unless you change yourin your take you like some theoremswhenever things like a surprise but thekind of theorems that you prove for astar search and you and they don't existand you would understand okay yes[Music]that's all convexity so for example ifyou have you know your function is likethis then there is only a minimum rightand so you will asymptotically find thatminimum even there is not guaranteedthat you will find the minimum in lifepattern by because if the function islike this and you are at this point andyou may have figured out that we shouldmake a step in this direction but howsmall should disturb be with the reasonI'm bringing this awha essentially isproblems and what is worth doing remainsthe same in some problems some settingsfor a group and it's just you know it'simportant to kind of make theconnections the only way things willstay in your mind is defend buteverything is connectedif the isolated comes at a fall throughthe cracks yesnone of them change anything I said soiterative deepening I just want to makesure that you understand what is fastlike so you have a search tree like thisand essentially you are looking at thistree in interracial vibration where theiteration is done in terms of the P whatis nothing but cheap then all the edgecars are you need cuts so let's see ifyou can toss around unit cost II octavois equal to the number of edges travelwhich is exactly equal to Chi right okayhowever there is something interestingkeep that in mind the special guest Gwith that in mind and so my question isof course how does idea s work it worksby essentially starting with that comeout to be 0 and that means any moment soit's letting the third of them expandnorth any time in you know hood comesand it's kept is greater than the depthcut off it says no it not existthrowdown you see what I'm sayingso you are looking at only pieces of thetree so for example you would firstequation will be like shut up equal to 0basically means only this kind will comeinto pictureeverybody else is bothI technically to the next one the nextone how do you see trees if previouslyequal to zerowhat would the value what you think isstupid questions because something likeG so you should be asked the samequestion in terms of what would happenif I was doing in terms of we will startsure okay so first we equal to 0 andthen it becomes D equal to 1 so thatwill be 3 now I think this beautifulNorse you do that perception if there isno sure oh thank you will again expandgame 3 for North Rita and this is abigger tree in this tree to do thatfirst search so notice actually thattree now is this this the other guysdon't exist now when you do depth-firstsearch is tubing the convention thatmenu you know basically put that you'llcome out then youbut you're showing it up they grab likethis light like this really this uniqueworld at first but in the doing thiswhat's more important is the harder youreach the children are put on the stackbut children's children will get put ontop of them so this is by the way if youever get confused about depth-firstsearchthink about royal families andprimogeniture right the eldest guybecomes the king Elizabeth you know Katebecomes the key are the Queen and if thefather or mother never dies and he skydies in the before her thensimply not become the king this guyescapes become Kingsthat's primarily the sleeve for thatstack on that's what happens in so thepoint is that the DFS if you want tothink in terms of how DFS works it'sbasically good to work this node thenthese two nodes put it on the stand thenyou pick one of these nodes byconvention we'll pick the left node thenwe it's two children put it on the stackthen you expand this then you expandthis to expand that steps first it'sextremely important to understand that Idetective systematic searches are verydeep in depth first search in particularis going to use that first in everyiteration why because the only searchstarted will move that is guaranteed togive linear space is that first rightokay so don't follow borrow after thishaha I do breakfastthis is the open list hopefully all thedoors that are remaining to be expandedand anything on the open list haspointers because of it experience tosurvive okay the bigger the open thisthe more space the research is becausethat is going here only ever puts Ptimes he knows three times B knows undercamp at the maximum whereas the flatfaucet will have to put the last flinchother Q last fringe is also made up ofPMD except there is placed verticallythe already dead the times Toh so because that's where the and so Iget to say okay now if you are doing itfirst such have this property that firstsearch has these properties intuitivedeep link a person how so has thisproperty because eventually it will turnit every store now when you come to thisdon't turn any store more than onceproperty which search strategy familiesthat first search definitely it willnever be open you know at least increasegraphs and African interestingplease eat or return okay that's firstthe same thing iterative definitionfailure official failure because itactually infinity professor has expandedthis tour once entities zero once morein the t 103 once more in the d23 ascore is a t-33 so if the goal is thatkept the group mode has been expanded dplus 1 times so that that would looklike a systematic search so I want tochange my definition such thing torecognize dramatically so what could Isay at most more than K times where Kcan be a large constant can be accountedconstantokay[Music][Music]so how do you define the bouncethey were defined in terms of eventsyes David but he was actually aplaceholder for the Chi has caddiesreally the big guy in town is cheap whenthe uniform cost search you have to putin terms of key values nobody knows itbecause it's huge here's my question youstart with the pasta chief or the zerogroup node will come and that's not agoal no gee who's it one yeah why onewhat if in fact what if in fact all theedge cars are point one by doing onebasically little go to the bottom of atreeso in terms of what is the next highestG value so the way you would actually dothat is it's actually possible and I'mtelling you this because once I tell youthis when we complete a star search astar circuit the combination of uniformour search with some estimate about howfar below and you can do i PS r slashwhich is iterative deepening a star suchthat would be just like infer masked itrelatively blazer instead of tea youwill be doing the limit in terms ofthree values here and in terms of Fvalues in the okay so you wind upfiguring out what mode what would be thenext eval you is you start with G equalto zero
