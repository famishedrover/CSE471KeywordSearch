[Music]in addition to providing this BayesNetwork then you have to provide theCPC's and some property tables and youcan reduce the number of numbers and theconditional probability tables butassuming specific types of conditionalprobability distributions so just Mperiods in the worst case you need topower their numbers but by assumingadditional restrictions on thedistribution thank you reduce the numbersecond okay in particular that you cansee surprising at all to actuallyprovide let's say a distribution forcontinuous variable given a variant youwould need infinite number of numbersbut you know when whose infinite numbersin fact the first distributions youlearned or things like that onedistribution how many numbers do youneed for a normal distribution you canmeet are you need the variance that's itand then you plot c2so normal distribution is the additionalassumption over and above everythingelse you do this is what I'm sayingso that's how you actually reduce thenumber of numbers so first problem isJoint Distribution requires to borrownumbers to specify and those numbers areallowed addresses so we can use Bayesnetworks to reduce the numbers and justlook at the conditional probabilityconditional probability also can be verybig if the network is too denseif nodes have too many payments thesenodes have too many parents you're deadright because the sizethispension for example is proportional tothe goal with the maximum number ofedits okay that you can reduce thenumber of earrings if you happen to knowthat the parents are asking foraffecting the child in particular waysfor example consider the followingscenario note rate which is anothervariable given over 1/4 over 2 is 4 over3 is 4 rumors or sporophytesor how much with a bad spot for thetransport of a to score project 31st formeter mark for victim to score withempty score then reflection scoreanother spoon etc now this beautifuljust like you as well to be various thispractices to compute its conditionalprobability imagine just assume maybe 15assessments in this class so I need topower 15 numbers actually but what if Iwere to tell you that your final gradeis some sort of a knitted summation ofall these numbers then I introduce thisin a variable called the s√°mi variablethe some variable dependseach of these guys I'm gonna needanother song nobody has more than oneperiod you just write it was easywithout loss of generality know wheneveryou say be equal to NP it's never everthe generality basically will be losthere because I said human greed onlydepends on the sum of all yourassessments if for example your gradedepends on it actually givesdifferential treatment to certainassessments more than other assessmentsand there is no linear way of combiningthem if some variable is what you feelyour grade depends on I know betterdo you understand what I'm saying okayso to reduce the CVD size if I havesomething like this I can introduce theit is variable such that you have anetwork like this and you can easily seethat you can use the number of numbers -that's hugeokay the last one are our dimension isus DVDs can be quite hard to specifygiven any number of parents that youhave you still have too many essentiallynot it is reciprocated in that case youwill do that trick like what normaldistribution does it says I can computerincrease from just a few numbers I don'tneed to mark a numbers so that is thelast one that I wanna mention yeah thisis what's all the noise the ourdistributionso this is what happens and if captainfire you still living depends on our TVsee if the probability each of the thisis let say P then the probability thatall of them will base will be P 1 timesP times P times P 50 positive if so theprobability that will actually die isevery other case which is 1 minus thisis your M say this final squad is whatis captured by an IC our distribution sofor example essentially there can bemultiple passes for fever cold flu andmalaria can alphas fever but they alsocause it poison that means sometimesforgives youit doesn't sometimes what area gives youif they were sometimes ago sometimes youknow flu gives you fever sometimesoccurs but they save you probabilitiesare independentat which point normally if I have threevariables and feel one conditionprofitable for a what I will read eightnumbers however I'm showing you here isI only need to have numbers I'm going toneed to give you the requires for therows where only one of them is proof ifmalaria is true you not get in favor ispoint one problem that means mother canbe seenokay and similarly if mu is true you notget it till this point to that's Rubyscene and it's always true do not get infavor is points of things that we that'sonly see given these three numbers andthe Messiah of Ness of distribution youcan compute all other numbers is whatI'm saying if for example if youconsider something like this through andmalaria is it there for you not to getfever both of them should say which isone to ten twenty one which means youget in favorite one minus tan Phi minusand now some of you think I don't likemultiplications just give me morenervousthat's puzzles because that will berequiring more assessment it has MuSigma knows what it leaks one I want Iwant my district table of numbers rightthat's no good okay so this is not mysay our distribution I see one is justlike normal distribution it is a compactdistribution that makes some additionalas such assumptions about how things areconnected so I will stop here particularsessiontake some more very powerful[Music]yeahyes[Music]so nobody knows that[Music][Music]so what can we do with this so first ofall the good news is we start in Francewith reduced expectations in thefollowing sense you know assessment ofassessment of satisfiability given a setof boolean variables a set of variablesin deterministic logic checking whetheramar this is the model for itokay that's already at me coming and youshould not be at all surprised thatmysticism is harder not easy because itnot only in a weird way you can think ofit this way given a problem mysticvariables what you're trying to computeis number of models not just one moreall the models in which the obviouslyconstraints for essentially that's whatyou want so it's not surprising at allaccommodation has differences not onlycheaper it's essentially away you canactually do this to show actually if youare a theoretician you can say that hereis a satisfiability problem is the 3satproblem okay and you can convert thisresearch problem into a very networkokay such that I gather these threesubclasses have ais connecting to whether this basenetwork the and variable has twoprobability you can say and so thatbasically tells you that these networkcapture and okay furthermore in fact soin fact but one of the interestingthings essentially is that one of us isthat we basically can actually show ifyou're into thatit's what Scott sharp P completeinference and publish the assessment heshall take a pic which actually wascounting the models not just finding onemodel but counting the number of modelsprocess okay but there are easy casesjust like watching has in the casesremember on pathological cheaper thannot okay for you the cheap is for youonce up in in in the Netta basement wasthe cheap case happens to be essentiallyany network that's what's got simplyconnecting a simply connected network isa network where there is at most onepath between any pair of nodes in thegraph and most on that okay so forexample this is the kinematic so is thisto be a connected this found other handis not singling I'd you know but this isa bad guy visa you know this guy is notsimply connected which might beconnected okay so it turns out that youcan show that for simply connectednetworks exact inference is polynomialform are deeply connected networks whichis the other side you knowthey calculated what the network isMaalik we can take at least a pair ofnodes has more than one but it's notthat if people have more than one atleast one page simply connect means ifwe paid as at most one now theinteresting thing is thankfully theparty reuptake scenario that we saw isimplemented this one is also simplyconnected what was this vital Markovchain Markov chains you ran you work alot with multiple chains because they'reactually easy to do difference just likeProlog uses on worthless okay how aretheseis that simply connected or partic thecontents what is it didn't become oneonce again these are my peopleour business look for last piece underthe light like it it's not that theworld is made up our hidden Markovmodels and Markov chains it is that theyare easier to solveso you just woke that it's a macro chainyou hope that I'm saying okay so notsurprisingly it turns out that all ofthese would be simply connected networksright the other one of our said ofcourse this one is a bad guythis is the multiplicative networkbecause at least there is no more zombieand where traffic has more than one andin those cases it can be shown that it'snot all that then existent is somewhatlimitedokay now here's the tricky thing sinceit's late in the nightI'll tell you what Pete win parent we dowhich is if this is not all Muriel rightthis is what your problem isso I will essentially merge those twoknots sprinkle a tray sprinkle somebrake do this note are split laspurslane know if these guys can take twoFalls and this is getting too fastvalues this takes four values true falsetrue true false false false true andfurthermore I can if I know the CPD'sfor this network and and the CPD's forthis network without asking any morequestionsso did I just show people tell mebecause this one is simply connectedtransit this one is in we connected andI Doria simply connected networks arephenomenal and I just took a my deeplyconnected network which is a bad thingI'm converting table T it's likeconnection conversion what happened whyis why I'm a typhoon equal degree I meanfor computer science people he sees thestuff that you should check it stuffthose random proof they say 1 equal todo that is that the physics people willsay loop it never stops it's perpetualmotion okay for Adamas people theequivalent is equal then if somebodysays be equal to NP 6 that you recordhasn't yet been given up for that youknow that they're making up andsomething went wrong somewhere so whatis the problem[Music]so it's very important to understandthat complexity is a function of sizecomplexity is a bunch of input sizesokaydo you not start up saying if you canalways take something which takes ittakes a five input and that exponentialcomputation I'm converting intosomething that takes five power fiveinput and does fall under competitionit's your heart if you don't believe methink of the following scenario we toldyou mdps are quite a number in number ofstates MVP inferences for Mandela numberof steps computing policies and I alsotold you the PDF planning which isreally not actually the activity problemit is not doing the stochastic planningit's not doing reward I've written inwords it's actually very simple wordsand it definitely planning videoplanning I told you is pspace completehow can the chip or problem be otherdatawhat was the difference what are thedifference these are the questions youguys have asked yourself what is it yeswhat is the input here it's a number ofstates here is number of propositionsit's polynomial in the number of statesif I have n variables and M statevariables to be polynomial in to power nis the same as being exponential in youguys should know these thingsyou understand I'm saying not if life isnot just check you need tounderstand why people are doing funnyHIV while just seeing Udacity in microlectures okay what's the differenceokay so basically when you combine thiswith the input size and so of courseyeah for now we are in thisexponentially larger input sizein fact you increase the input sizeexponentially because this day will beexponentially larger than these potatoesokay this is your perpetual motionmachine fire computer science fineso you understood this first of all thatsinglet is easy but if it is hard butthen I want to talk about inference fastin general kinds of mostly any kind ofinference that we do is give meposterior distribution of some variablesgiven some evidence that's pretty muchthe inference that can be frustrating[Music][Music][Music]but what if you want to get down beforethe world ends you want to make a fastin particular if you have a network withvariables and you are asking it maybeinvolving just two of them the mostpieces should be able to answer thatwithout looking at h1 distributiontherefore that is to power million thisis what I'm sayingthat's what inferences are so of thisinfluence we'll talk about two kinds ofinferences exact inference which youpretty much understand and the crosswordinfluence that I sort of mentionedearlier but hopefully we'll come backtogether exactly fools in essence youcould compute the path after JointDistribution that is needed to answeryour way that's it so rather thancompute the American distribution on astreet baby you look at the very andonly compute the you know the rows thatare meeting you see what I'm saying ifyou do that you can save and surprise meand that's that's first product andthat's this one and the second outerwhich we will get to after first orderbasically say is not only do you justpick the piece of the transmission thatis actually required but even computingthat you might be repeatingmultiplicationyou might be reaching applications so ifyou ever computed something once youremember which are memorization so thatif you give me that same computationover there as you do that memorizationthat you get to that idea okay but yousee where it's when you start thesimplest zero cannot make their owndistribution and then it sounds reallygoodsecond is only computer scientist to bedeparted I need the third is do that butwe are very poly and imagine I'm tryingto compute this way distribution givenJohn Akkad and Mary card so theAssumption here is capital letters meansI want the distribution since it's aboolean and I need to write and thenevidence is always given exactlyso John God and maybe God those are thesmall letters if John think of if youhappen to know that you are indeedcontinents energy this much Georgeso I'm trying to compute these okay soI've used my rules conditionalprobability situation with definition Isay is nothing but my PJ and then peopleI spend some time when talking to youlast class about Bayes rule and I don'tlike the evidence part which is comingin the joint if the distribute theproperty the evidence which is coming inthe denominator so I would rather assumeone over that is equal to alpha and thenif I get the full distribution here wehave four times J and half a time scalewould be thatso then I know the actual properties tobe alpha times J by alpha times J plus Kthis what I'm saying so that's what I doso I basically just assumed that I wouldnever be able to compute GM I can justbe that would be the distribution for meI'll just write this as alpha times yacapital V J this is the trick that weshould understand because you know inbusiness do you see this way because youdon't need PJM because you're going toget property P being true and probablybe being false you have the map it mustbe one so if I get those two numbersbefore and seven then they have twoprobabilities are 4 by 11 and save itwherever that's the hepatic right but Ijust assume that Google so I did thatand so this is nothing but so I justneed alpha x PP j now given this guy Iwant to come through the joint digitsany event single jointed leave thencomputed I showed you over there righthow I did is can I believe this up fromthat no why because it's actuallymissing two of the variables so I needto marginalize those two variables thetwo variables are missing are earthquakeand so I put a signal over the power ofP P image in here this is just mathright of this particular expressionJill and F are already in a dream he andL are going to be decided by thesummation you know consider a to be trueoncethis is a compact we are basically 19:4mappers summation of four numbers yousee this and then you do this for Bequal to 2 1 7 equal to thousands rightso at this point that right now theJoint Distribution entries this will beour Joint Distribution entries so youknow completely any of the distributionis my - look method because you know howto use the local independence officialsso in particular suppose I write so ppmwill be equal to alpha times thissummation alpha can be written as ppmcan be essentially in the topologicalorder because maybe he will be rejectedand here we have given me I didn't doanything magic I just basically got youup to this point by saying this is howwe compute maybe Joint Distribution ifyou don't want anything else from Bayesnetworks right so what is that in thisparticular I actually just added up theset of the initiation entries areimmediately ok and furthermore one ofthe other things I can do is these twosummations don't have to be done at theleftmost side I can push the summationinsidefor example is this okay essentiallythat if you this guy this last card butas far as do this computational graphthis program and I know the wordcombination of graph was also used forthe gradient competition but what dayswe used to use foundation graphreligious programs okay so the programbasically is saying what things areready being added to what games aremultiplied with what things to do whatis right and I would say this thisparticular thing is this a measure ofthe papa
