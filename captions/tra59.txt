it's infinite but we will go to H equalto na more finite number and then whatis yesyeah so what happened okay okayand then this by the way is a VP forfinite state space and finite actionspace you can generalize this toinfinite state space continuous statespace and continuous action space wewill talk about it here but generallywhenever in this class we will see a bigsummation Sigma in your mind if youconverted into an integration then thatcontinues okay but we want magneticorigin oh one more thing about thevariation on this is a story inidentities until now I looked at so youcan look at work life in two differentways and both are very good and as Isaid a glass is half-fullthe glass is half-empty that objectivitytrue you know it's just in one caseyou're thinking about what's missing nowthe case you're thinking about whatstake right similarly they think ourlife is like this I had in casing it andsee new happiness that would be thereward with you like with a huge dragand then you die that's the custodycompletely true okay so you could modeland we face this way in terms of our SAS- for each transition you get an awardfor a good pointgive some money and so if you aregetting bad that means it's not actuallya good boy divider from the other getyou then I say I'm getting negativitywatch negative what is positive castright and then opposite is alternatemodel is fast paced their duties youessentially say each transition ifthere's an immediate cost eachtransition occurs an immediate cost andthat would again most general case ifyou see SAS - and then the goal here isto come up with a policy PI thatmaximizes the expected humor it everyonethat the agent gets from every state andthe Rema that is the value the expectedcumulative reward is called value andmaximizing it that's optimal value instuff you can to think in terms of stuffin the case of cost you in fact that netbenefit ei star will be thinking interms of cost me right and the last viewthe goal is to come up with a policypackage that minimizes the expectedcumulative cost from every stateagain do one expected because it'sfantastic city you run the same policytwice it gives you different sequence ofsteps okay this one is called J starthis is the few rows if you taken in thereinforcement learning community peopletend to think in terms of rewardsbecause the reinforcement learning as aword came from psychology and Skinnerwill be any started talking about thisand they basically try to train rats todo well in mazes and I thought what arepeople who are slightly bigger backs andso that's what we learned in fact thereare interesting stories that Skinnerwould have a skinner box first inMesquiteand then still kid master probably okaythis is the other view these are otherhands is the view taken in the searchand control theory literature how manyof you have heard after coherent anybodywith electrical engineering backgroundwould have out of control there it turnsout that many many different areasappoint observers in power operationsresearch is trying to find out what'sthe best addition to take control theoryis trying to figure out what's the bestdecision today yeah agent is trying tofigure out what's the best decisiontoday of all the agency is it is themost beautiful mechanical rule we thinkbut and also it's the most popularsubject right now but and so thosepeople are saying we have come out thisbook is in fact we have done this beforeyou guys in fact how many have torecognize this cap is a new youngfaculty member joining our departmentand his name is Dmitry forsake ushe was for all his life he was an MITdecision Sciences professor and he startand son comes and answers work incontrol theory and what basically MVPsfrom a faculty perspective and my job isthat III write books the way otherpeople write papers just like fifteen ortwenty books and you know he's prettyamazing guy is coming here theinteresting thing is so when he camebecause because coming here is youengineering is obviously celebratingthis will be a 60 faculty member andcelebrating it so they wrote an articleand it became a sternotomy we keepmemorizing our Brickyardwhat is he vandalizing it with just ahyes ah there's only one principle inlife which is computing the optimalasked to go the man lived in a car Kenyaand 80 have so books based on this okayand in fact it just is the optimal costto go at a speed s news from X to youusing genie oh geeDimitri actually likes to keep in termsof us so it's fascinating because thekey terms are passed up to that pointthe g-man so G of X you plus theneighbors Jays family and this by theway is called Feldman's optimalityand if you are into villager andcomputer science right now you shouldcreate a culture because this is one ofthe most important equations that youwill see it and they didn't actuallycover your life for the next severalclasses plus the rest of your lifeand so in this particular case noticewhat they're doing they really mightthink so in fact what we are saying iswe don't know how to compute optimalcost to go but it will have thefollowing property my optimal path to goto go so if I'm here I can go in thisstate this state is steady state if Ihappen to know there are two markers togo and I know the Kosta and property ofme go into those states then I cancompute my optimal capital that willcome from the node that is the bestneighbor in particular the best actionthat I can take from where our act andthese finds are basically thisminimization you will see the sameequation next class with inspection youwill say mewe start adding stuff builds you willsay max because for the warts you wantto have so much is nothing much[Music]
