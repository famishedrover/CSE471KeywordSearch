then in a sense notice that from 2012discussion 2001 discussion for aprogrammer to give this to an AI agentthe programmer should have a theory ofthe problem so this can only really bedone sarcastic knowledge tests I'm sorryexplicit knowledge tasks but therearen't really many explicit knowledgeshe does because we designed this one begiven to a large extra it isn't that youknow we are just living in the worldthat was given to us we stabilize theheck out of this world we created theproblems that we saw to our text so wedo have explicit knowledge and so we canprovide that information and if you doprovide that information when thatquestion becomes a simple computerscience questions question which is howdo I figure out given the knowledge howdo I figure out my tests at that levelthis is just pure algorithms yourcomputer science that's not actuallythat stuff you were doing for 50 let'stalk in general okay normally you neverask me my cut of science algorithmscourse I wouldn't give you the problemyou solve it there is no such thing youare given a crisp definition oftraveling salesperson problem and itkilled your son trying to solve do youunderstand what I'm saying right sothat's basically the first side I caninitially so that's one timethe other part is I am only interestedin I'm only interested in nowessentially dealing with problems whereI learned everything that I'm using so Iwant to take any input from outsiderseither agent which will be essentiallyyou focus on learning you can keep upwith us two different complimentaryapproaches clearly this is more relevantfor explicit knowledge tasks and this ismore relevant for tacit knowledge testand after that I also say thatwe have killed as acknowledged - I'm nosuch PSP or explicit knowledge as wemight have a problem there 90% of thestuff you understand and so you canwrite it down a little water Street hasto be learnedokay and in fact one of the things youcan do learning so it's a case ofalphagoby the tape you know any of the chessprograms and so on these are explicitknowledge test the program is not tryingto figure out the rules of the game byyou looking at me complaining go it hasbeen given the rules of the game buthaving given the rules of the gamefinding the optimal evening strategy isextremely hard the computational problemdo you understand what I'm saying soit's like a funny thing that lot ofpeople forget that he went if I give youthe problem solving it can be undecideda computational perspective okay so thisseparates our focus it's faster thesearch teams that all will figure outhow to do the running part later andthis approach saga focuses on the otherlearning part and sui OLC which will bedodizzily so people in this world issaying things like one of these days ouragents will do reasoning that's becausethey have not any reasoning in theirlives they only focus on for examplevisual tasks and where there is noexplicit knowledge and so they basicallyhad to learn whatever they had to useand you knowokayit's what well understanding that thetextbook is written with this directionand you just take a few missionary forcein politics it's not because listeningis not important it is the thing that wehaven't gotten around to everyscientific discipline pushes some thingsand otherwise every time we disagreestrand which has taken over that it'simportant to figure out what is portionof it so that you won't just be one moreof the people in peace what they read inokay so um yeah about this I'm going toprobably in the lecture that you saw iswhat one advantage here is that thehumans are giving their presentationsomebody outside is giving theirpresentation they are telling youwhatever features a human civilizationsacquire in moderation and B if you saythat you need help you can go back tothem and talk to them in the language ofthe features that they provided youbecause they actually understand thatwhile there are if you learn your ownrepresentations then if you fail unlessyou come up with an answer that I don'tmake sense of and I say why did you cometo this and you would say something thatwill be covered it because you aretalking in a completely differentlanguage language is about shadeunderstanding this you what I'm sayingthe reason we can't go off to otherwords and talk to them you know is notonly because language difference theshared understanding sometimes might beyou could point to things that doesn'trequire language and that might help youbetterso example the problem of interpreterTrinity that has become a huge thing inAI our plate has to be understood interms of this power it's only you loveyour own representations you may relyagent starting from our data then youmay travel doing stuff that I have noclue about then I will ask you forexplanations and those are explanationsthat are harder to even understand thosewould oftentimes be pointingexplanations and in in the context ofimages sometimes quietly explanationthat is possible you say why did youthink of this as whatever Alaskan Huskyis it and then show what I think is nomatter there you go so that's no that'snot just because there is no thatdoesn't make the talk about famous easyenough if on the other hand if you askWow why did you bring bicycle today forexample okay I have to make anexplanation for my position and if Ihave to I have to point to thespace-time tube of my life heunderstands itlike me now maybe my bodyan extremely inefficient they imagineanyone who asked somebody explainsomething they saynow let me play Amen and then you marktogether you have to assume that thehuman civilization really happenedbecause we could avoid this kind ofpointing explanations in most of thecases okayand for that is this issue of intercredibility problem and the fact thatit's more of an issue here than hereokay yes you were this is they justlearn what is YouTube videos I think itshould say Facebook videos but somehowit says YouTube videos and then it isnot because in fact funny thing is spacefive tubes of normal life exists on theYouTube and our life is too short thatwe don't watch them right but a programcan just watch large numbers of spaceand cubes and try to make some sense ofokay by the way this is the beginning ofthe port's huge number of problems areopen problems otherwise my introductionI would be doing one of these executivecourses where I say everything is Prasadyou just give me the money else out thewrong way okaythese are open problems okayand there are no answers penis in factone month I trusted that I don't evenwant to get into actually ELISAthere's a beautiful slide that I hitcounter Nicaragua one deaf childrenproblem amazing issue where childrenbasically devise their own language lessto themselves they have deaf children inDecalogue were during the war time missArsena it was a garden and the childrendesigned their own language and thatlanguage has no connection to any signlanguage that existed before and yeahinterestingly people were able to learnthat languagewhat's even more mind-blowing is that inthe space of all possible languages thatyou can have in a universe that signlanguage is closer to human signlanguages that anything else you couldhave come up with if you just basicallyand imaginary language that blows yourmind to some extent we are shaped in asense the same types of mind brain andso there are some interestinglimitations on the kinds of things wecan come up with you know we are outcomplain to each other and say oh thislanguage has only make sense my languageis much better as all human languagesmake sense and they are actually a smallreally small subset of the possiblelanguages okay so actually interestrequestion about why the you know if youwere to think in terms of whether or notkeeps a learning this way or this waywhat would you say by the way half it'snot in this worldhow many people think that it's ourlearning this way Twinkies in generalyou must I say you - miss Elise how doyou think they say why are you takingthis class I'm telling you you should betoldshould just observe the world and figureout what he isyou see what I'm saying and somebodysaid human colony is in between somepieces are from this side something upon this side they are not toys andSpotfire living that way so a plan aboutyou parties for me to say mister meansyou start with efforts focus and thenfor a victim leaving some learning intoit because that's more or less more ofthe left-hand side but we shift intoright-hand side sometimes especiallywhen they're at acid test but which Ican actually provide any reasonablefeatures DCR I'm saying things like afuture like the manpower pieces left onthe chess board is a semantic feature afeature like H is a syntactic featureand what computer vision people who doand they're giving hand for the teacherswould be terms of things like youunderstand for example okay and so thereyou can provide the features okay sothen that gets us to problem solving isit the atomic agent and so in essence asI mentioned already so in some sense weare looking at this the architecture andso we assume that by this part willassume that the stakes are black boxesbut once the name I will providestructure to it but even if we provideswatch it is only toyou are or easier than anything elseokay because the program the searchalgorithm doesn't you get a scratch asmuch okay this is actually tricky partyou have to really try to understandbefore the search algorithms are overthat none of your search algorithms thatthey see human evolution is the bigdifference in the research of the richyou understood thatfirst is the FQ is methylated the queuecontains our butter TVs they don't lookinto the things you see what it has theyjust basically at first says where is inthe you know whoever target but youfirst will be taken out faster deficitswere at the top of stack will be takenout first they don't look at therepresentation okay so that's why theseare actually problem solving agents youshould think of them as this will beblind to the representation of escapeokay and so you're given initial statewhich is some indivisible state you giveit a child generator function which is apiece of whole fact eight system andgive some states and you're even I callthis function which takes a state andsays yes it's the goal no it's not atall these are the only pieces you aregiven and in fact from the datastructure point of view we'll come to itin a minute but instead of thechocolates actually look at what arecalled nodes and the node is a datastructure once water which is the statethe other slots basically in that nodedata structure a bookkeeping stuff likewhich node was expanded to get this nodeand as we go into things like a star somuch what is the total cost you spend toget to this node and to understand moreand state of different you can have twodifferent nodes with the same state butthey have different costs in anundirected graph you can go from A to Bgo back for me - here come back again tome you now have to search notes with meas the state one is the bozos stateright because it better get it back backand forth and in fact a problem thatbasically builds good hold at any giventime the agent seriously is against itbut that essentially assumes that theagent is able to look at the state andrecognize what stable if it is partiallyobservable world and any given point ofpie in the worldthat's 18,000 of what exact state iteasywhat that means is it is one of manydifferent statesnot knowing the state only means thereis a disjunction in the number of statesthat you think you might be if you don'tknow anything about where you are and ifit's a state space of size ten thousandthat means you think you're more of a10,000 steps it's not infinitely largeunsettling okay I'm so in fact most ofus we also work for inaccessibility soin fact most of it the ones that willget this class the next class will workfor any deterministic problemdeterministic means an action gives riseto a single state action of life theystate these displace againstwhat that essentially means really isthere is this you know gene or and hasno time corresponding to the state s andthen you apply the child generatorfunction to it and then it gives rise towhole bunch of nodes and each of themkind of correspond to doing differentoperations even the operators themselvesare essentially indirectly representedto the problem solving okay so that'swhere all the conditional bookkeepingrender it let me so in fact the point isthe moment you have inaccessible orpartially observable world you still cando the same algorithms that we aretalking about in fact the a-star searchwill still work except instead ofsearching like a space of size s ifthere's s is the number of states it hasto Mouse search in the space of allsubsets of the set of spaces peopleunderstand what I guess how many subsetsare there for s things- ball s in general by the way a goodheuristic is for the Mexican about if Iask a question money requires somenumber say - power okay if you have astate and you can't see which state youare inthen in essence you are searching infrom power s size of it's now states arerepresented in terms of M statevariables such that s equal to 2 power Mso really when you lose your eyesightyou are searching in to power to powerthat's what losing eyesight you suddenlyyou now asserting your friends aresearching in a much smaller spacethat's the one-ders access to them youare stuck with having to search in amuch larger space sometimes in fact wemay not even be able to reach school andif you can reach goal it's a much hardersearch for youthat's a computation way ofunderstanding what happens when you loseranges okay and somewhere along the linelike I said that so mu power is the evilevery CS students nightmare should bemade up so if you wake up in a coldsweat in the middle of the night itbetter be because you okay so that's ingeneral one is bad news okay okay so somuch in the deterministic environmentsso now that we set up like basicallyproblem solving it dead so if I'msearching the space of Romania map forwhatever reason textbook usesbut I'm fabulous the goal that's a teamis relative in Romania effects like andthen populate the problem the states arethe Middle East it is okay and theoperators are wide between the citiesnotice that they formulate formulateformulate its because this is anexclusive college class and you areproviding our knowledge about the pastto the program and you can provide youcan back up representations and firstrepresentations that's the questions areof Randolph area maybe there arerepresentations which are kind of toofluffy the sense they allow for manymany states are not actually legal atall and then they will get stuck indoorsbut in it so for the volume states arevery serious operators are drivingbetween the cities so I assume there areat the final solution is the sequence ofstreet these are basically the road isthere are multiple rows which messagesthen you also talked about sequence ofcodes but you know in the map that theyhad this is the way their map is rightand so if I am I see a lot and I want toarrest them I'm trying to find thesequenceafterwards that I have the assistance ofintercept is done that you mark the wayto get through okay so one of theinteresting things is that by the end ofthis class you should all be especiallythe set of pointers shall we eat theRomania you should be remain the expertsso a while back I was coming back fromIndia a lot of mix that and on theflight they show the map and I saw thisto start doing the a-star searchwhen I see the job you should do suchinterest in me actually there werealways you know I said textbook has beenthe most influential textbook unit ofaii time and there were all thesebacterias that various people who madeup as two white women in the amount andmatrix to our castle is Romanian as inEnglish and maybe tweeter Magni is anAmerican so-called American send it fromanywhere so maybe it's from Romaniaturns out he was awesome - oh man yes sohow far can we turn he said we justwanted to come up with a understandmany potholes there okay so the newstate politicians we have are theyunderstand them so that you understandthat in fact you will need to do like abunch of problems on this because thisis an odd function science can be doneare two needs to be practiced okay anart form is if you know the problemanyone who did it to you algorithm whatshould be the best representation ofstatesI'm fact again a friend talked about itthat they could be multiple differentrepresentations are the better versuswatch the presentations that you couldcome up with at is depending on youso this is not about AI this is aboutyou giving a more compact representationthrough search algorithm such when youget done faster this is what I'm sayingokay so you generally thinking aboutthis that you basically realized thatactually yes you should understand rightthere is no actually the point in theworld called cebu there's no singlepoint to the wild card till be rightthey basically just abstract out andsaying the center point of each citywhich is arbitrarily defined isconsidered that seem right and so it'san abstraction okay so you have the realworld in two statesyeah therefore in two states you haveside reactions in two transitions you doall these abstraction and then you letthe program figure out the categorieswhich is what a good computer scientistobject okay and so figuring this out isnot obvious and then once you come upwith the solution once this out in termsof resolution just basically is a squadsolution rightgo from Allah to Cebu and then you chewand then release me and then toBucharest there are all sorts of crazythings that might be happening in eachof these rooms instead I'm saying I'msubtracting other so that jewel tragicthat the agent will take would be manymany static trees would be correct withrespect to this abstraction ok so that'sthe notion of abstraction that theytalked about it this is basically whatwhile keeping in mind because you willbe made to do some number of some numberof examples on this again this is afunny thing on one hand basic problemsolving agents don't care about theinternal structure of the state buthowever and they're saying actually it'suseful to have some kind of arepresentation so that you are out therethere yeah you have to write the childgenerator function you have to write thegoal test function you the designer andyou might as well have a goodrepresentation it's almost like saying3/10 come on put data structure that'swhat you need okay first of all let mepoint out that you know that we kissedsuccess stories after off search isreally happening right you are you arebasically in your google maps etc isvery quickly the computing cuts when yousay I want to go from here to here andit basically has the map it's not codeencode learning the map it's not tryingto say ok suppose I make this you knowRoad that is betweenyou know to see a class you know fromeach other like for example suppose theythey direct road from soft to knock itthat just take that top of the make anysense whether it those of you or you canassume some reproductive as grow flyseries lucky mice as you dragon is 220miles because you have to come out ofthe Grand Canyon go all the way to theother side there is no noso essentially what Google Maps this isactually good set up notes that existthat we need and then it's figure it outand different routes have differentcosts for example the interstates mightbe faster and some minor roads might beslower and one of the more interestingthings that it does learn actually he'snot gesture you understand this redstuff on the maps that you know roadsare not made with that stuff right andit's basically because it's learningwhat roads are congested do you know howit is done do you know how all theseprograms which one person is exactlyoutsource data if you want to stick itto Larry Page leave all your cell phonesat home right there is a everythinglooks goodbecause they also notice that there's nocops moving in front of me if you don'tbasically can't open it the cell phonesand the cell phones are you are thesensor your cell phone is a sense it'salways giving away information about youin the old days it was only giving yourcoordinates message given your age youhave you know interest inokay but that's basically what happensthroughout so slow it's not like majorlearning back situation okay anyway souseful so you can actually computethings like you know each class batterokay um so then this is for thisactually you know what the presentationthere are other representation of oneone so the most obvious thepresentations people tend to think aboutfor this is essentially of course theywill say where each of the piles arewhat is the coordinate position but themost obviously presentation people tendto think of the actions being move findthree from variance to dispositionthat's what you would come up withthat's exactly where our friends pointcomes across which is most of that timeto do because you can't do three toseven because they're both put reallythe only movement that is allowed inpassive problems is blank moving it'sstrange you think actually why they moveover here that's not a good way ofthinking about it you say blank movesinto something next to it so sometimesgood representations can be slightlycounterintuitive the algorithms willwork even if you came up with a badrepresentationthey'll just be less efficient yourfinances okay so this is therepresentation essentially moving theplant left right except as a black hasits own life each moon around it'sobviously the original way of thinkingabout it because most people think theyare actually moving the spine becausethey're holding the writing moon butit's much better think of it as theholding the black and pushing it andthen that guy comes in advanced sothat's the art formokay and as I said of course if I hadactually found these back muscles whereif space is liquid to my peopledisconnect account okay okay in fact oneof the very interesting questions aboutlearning in general you know youunderstand even following this but oneof the other interesting things is thereare you know things like this when youhave obstacles in a two-dimensionalspace in a three-dimensional space andthe robot has to go from this place tothis place in the traffic a possiblethis is what all of our robots have beensearched for and it's how a reasonablerobot for all intents and purposes wecan assume it's the deterministicmovement when it tries to go power itactually goes power if you have a cheaporobot then it tries to go forwardsometimes it goes for morning which like80% of the time it goes for 110 percentof the time it goes left 10 possible andit goes right the energy forward 84,000time it goes forward 9 person over timeit was there was no time which goesright to possible time it goes it canhappenthey really bad robot okay and that'sbasically them uncertainty in generalmost people assume that if they moneythey have good one over robots and sothe problem would then be in a lodge
