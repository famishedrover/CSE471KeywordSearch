okay in particular notice I have a evergiven a and I have a Jacobin a and agiven B e then P of e and then PRP andin this site basically these two will bemultiplied these two will be multipliedadded is to be multiplied is to domagnified added those to be having atree that's what you are actually doingin the background they have will bepointa of that we give thiscomputational graph you are doing didn'tnetwork what is reader network you aremultiplying the same number seconddegree and there is no reason tomultiply them second time you shouldmultiply the months the answer with thesame the second time right and so youremember okay so in particular you knowD is that EJ a P and a is beingmultiplied first so the first one aremultiplying I remember it as a factorand a motive the second time this is theidea variable eliminationin particular particular what happensespecially is you start rememberingthese intermediate factors and once youcompute intermediate factor the secondtime around we won't have computed youjust look it up and you call themfactors rather than probabilitiesbecause they're not robberies rememberwe talked about this you know youmultiply some of the capitation or CPGtables after the experience multiplyingwe get a distribution okay it was thefinal question with variable lips is howquick can this store factors be you knowanything you get some amount of memoryto memorize itif you mind of my using by for examplejoint distribution then you're wastingtoo much space in particular turns outthat the order in which you eliminatevariables the order in which you kind ofmarginalize over variable variableelimination is maximization of theirvariance can we heat to smaller versuslarger intermediate factors and theoptimal order if you do it enough peopleorder you wind up computing the smallestintermediate factors which means as ayou do less computation and B you haveless storage okay so it turns out thatvariable elimination algorithms try tooptimize the order in which to eliminateMartin mais the variance and thequestion would be why not compute theoptimal order of elimination ofvariables the answer whenever there isany such question is well the onlyso reasonable if you actually okay Idon't expect you to have understoodI basically what you want you tounderstand that detonation isessentially an improvement this fasterrate this you should understand youshould be able to go home and you beable to get this number out yourselfokay if you want them at least you don'teven know any single right in fact ifyou do this you already know says youknow idea which is right in the advanceon distribution and looking at otherperson and then this is the second onewhich is slightly and then the other oneof course is especially going toremember variable factors that I need goto the details but is actually more orless the state-of-the-art exactinference and that leaves other half ofthe inference algorithms which isessentially sampling the network okaywhich is so let me give you an idea andthen I just most likely show you giveyou the videos to watch for this idea sothe idea would basically imagine ontrying to compute some but into theJoint Distribution entry in this tableokay what I need to do is suppose I justwanted to compute you know someprobabilitynetwork sampling this network the firstidea would be sample the entire jointingokay suppose I want the giant a tree andstart some cloudyI will sample the value for cloudy nowway to sample the relevant body able istelling me that probability of power ispoint five that means I need to getmyself a point which comes heads pointfive days point five pass it and wecomes hence I say it comes to Singaporethe faucet is very important thenimagine that I got the coffee rightthere suppose it turns out that I amhead so I have coffee now I need tosample sprinkler entry the idea is bythe time I got to speak well I alreadyknow of this value okay if the body istrue which is the property of sprinklercardamom is point one so now any now thepoint which come heads which comes haspoint one probability entails point nineproblem this is basically pointing at me[Music]for example if we generate a randomnumber between zero and one and thatnumber will essentially tell you thefollowing okay so for example in thiscase I gather a random number if it ismore than point one then I assumespeaker resolved if it is less than 0.1I just use Pequannock that'scomputer tossing and similarly I comehere the rain I will try to do this withrespect to the Ranaso I need point eight probability trueso I get in town a random number between0 and 1 if it is greater than point 8 Iassume rain is on rain is off that's thepoint 8 is uranium okay I'm samplingevery timenotice the sampling is important okay atthat point imagine that I had this sothat I wound up when I actually sampleeven what 0.1 meter will be on and thepoint 9 3 levels we are that's why moreor less with high probabilities peopleof Gaza so in my sample it doesn't meanthat speaking with authors they are Iactually have to see my tossing a coinokay and then this was ahaand so at this point I got a wet grassthese pagans are no this you're insaneand so what I actually know which kindadoes this is generating a signal samplefrom a network this is a single jointdistribution textile now if I want to dothis then if I just wanted to computeprobability if I wanted to computeyou know conditional probabilityprobability of something given someother variables having background okaythen what I would do essentially is newrejection sampling that means I sample awhole bunch of or bunch of disjointedplease see the number of entries will belet's say so you take the number ofentries where a and B are both true putthat in the numerator number of entrieswhere B is true in the denominator thatwill be your estimate of the conditionalproblem it's found rejection samplingbecause any increase that you generatedwith evidence wound up being not holdingso you said property P given E and thenyou generate the giant complete you makeit not eat so that is thrown awaybecause it does not have is thenumerator now the denominator so this isfor rejection sample is likely would bewhich basically says do whatever youwere doing before now instead of sayinga sample is the whole sample you canstart having fractional sampleslet me complete that idea so the samething except imagine I try to computesome property given sprinkler is trueand that grass is true so I want aconditional probability after it's acloudyso in the example where that croissantsprinkler not trueis there a strict sometimes I supposeI'm trying to learn kind of figure outwhat fraction of people who swore get anA in this class so how goes those whoare not swimming useless this you'reinsaneso I have to basically look for smokersand thanks the are might have thecredits so the samples where evidence isnot holding as rejected I got it theprevious one what happens here is youwill essentially compute a sample whichhas a fractional value cute idea okay sohere's the ideaso you start as usual before cloudy andyou're now trying to chocolate is inyour sample okay in this base or is trueand then at this point given the countyis true as definitely need sprinklerstill has to be true because it'sliterally is not true it won't be auseful entry it won't be in thedenominator of the numerator if in yourlives are not attributed to eithernumerator or denominator you're uselessto do something right so then what I dois pick let me to if I actually pass itone speaker might be false so I do fishyou are shaking and say okay sprinklehas to be true well if I you know clampsHitler to be true I need to assume thatthat only happen is point one probablyso I was trying to generate an entireone very example now I suddenly havereduced my absence I am generating[Music]it has to be true because of my luckokay so so so you can see what I justdidthis is one of the first great ideas ofsampling baseness voice because you arenot wasting any sound you areconsidering fraction of samples we wouldrather give you flatter assignmentsbecause you have and this is very smallthis baits are called likelihood weightsand whose I told you how to do thesampling proving that if you do thisinfinitely often you get the actualprobabilities that is the killer thetextbook actually proves that in factthat will converge to the actualproblemsokay this slightly rotating is a greatideain fact I'll go through it slowly in thevideo so I'll say okay and the last oneI won't mention at allis this Markov chain Monte run which Ikind of mentioned earlier we you saw asample and a quark even it's MarkovblanketI mean sample a variable given itsMarkov blanket and keep doing this andwhat happens then essentially is thisentire network in the differenttransformations and those configurationsstart off loop between each other givingdensity of a cone shape and if youcompute the steady state distribution ofMarkov chain from that you can of youokay I will stop here I will suddenlysend you the videos that you can watchjust for a sampling okay let me stop
