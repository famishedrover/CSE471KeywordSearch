we can start later but so this is how wetake so they did a short answer questionthat you should be able to see if youopen the room and actually have 90 50people give answers so you just have totype that code that's it[Music][Music]this is how it looks like me so startwith some gear the tip-offs ones willactually be more fun whether it doesplease helpokay so do this so there you see thatsometime after singularity theaudio/visual Cespedes will start workingwith health problems so after that webasically need a week's just make avicious transport yeahnot yet I only gave you one questionlike not so the question that iscurrently there is that in next questionand just so you know we're on one 30stocks becomes 130 this I start thelecture allowing for you know stragglersfor family because after all I was astraggler previous two days and at somepoint to find out too much talk and askquestion and then we will do thetrue/false questions one question thatshould have been only one question buthappiness questionthere are 184 people rather they areyou get into right[Music]musicindustries likeso I don't know how many of you havewatched this amazing movie but we have abunny train for our teaching I want toshow you that before we start[Music][Music]that's not a great way of cooking leftFTT in those days a big school investedof it and the students of course are thesmall micro tape recordersunfortunately this class is alreadyfashioned we actually are expectingfashion but people who live here butreally toughs what we should beeventually graduate into so themiddlemen we made is women are cut outcomputers teach computers learn andreally off somewhere in some planetanyway how many of you seen we aregeniusokay there's a long weekend coming rightwatch their geniusyes today's assignment is beer geniusyou can always catch up on our signcurve that should you find out okay sowe have 119 answers so those of you camein late please note that we are takingattendance so if you go into theSocrates app that I told you aboutthere should be one question askingwhat's the attendance code for todaythat's that about okay just like thatand that way we know that you areactually here and then we will also usethis not just for this but power thingsmore useful things like to falsequestions okay that's kind ofinteresting there are 79 people lockedin and 125 answers are not quite sureif you okay okay so we will get to thisin a few minutes but you probably talkedabout it we'll talk about it in sequenceactually that we justify also get onto[Music]so we you should give us a mail that wassaid today there are two importantplayers are saying one obviously if youdidn't know you will not know what'sgoing on about this attendance foryou're all supposed to have the you'resupposed to have the Socrative installedand then the second year is that thegreat score you are all being said thatgreat score registration instructions soyou should set it up so that you will beable to submit your project etc okay sothose are the two important things thathappened okay okay so what is this stillokay back okayso what we are going to do todayessentially is mostly go through whatyou have read somewhat quickly and thenadd some a few additional things tobring it up to date in terms of how whatthe course is doing compares to what youprobably heart adi course should bedoing if you only care aboutclassification learning which is maybethis is the stuff supervised learninghas been the stuff that's been making alot of fun have very heavy wear so youmay have thought about that so i want tokind of give you a sense of how thecoarse focus connects to as well asdiffers from somebody who might just beinterested in machinery yeah it's notjust a machine learning course that wealready are so you saw in the inter subthat you've read in the Chavez are youread that we're trying to make anintelligent agent essentially everythingis itof course I threw this speak robot whichis my kind of the talisman I kind ofgrew it a million years back and I keepusing it but in general it could be aprogram it could be a cipher entitydoesn't have to be an embodied entity atall okay the real question of course isany agent is art of interacting with anenvironment and each sort of trying totalk about the properties of theenvironment and the kinds of things thatthe agent can do you can it has someeffectors what we call actions and ituses though the effectors to makechanges to the environment okay if itdoesn't have any effect as that it'sjust an observernotice that agents can be observers infact there are some cases where theagent only wants to learn what's goingon in the world that we want to behaveat all in the world but the most generalcase and agent essentially wants tochange the environment in some ways thatwill make its goals being achieved whichbrings up this issue of what are itsgoals so it has some performance metricare some booths that is trying toachieve and it's trying to make surethat it is doing the actions that arethe all in the long term try to maximizeits performance metric okay now ofcourse as it does some actions itbasically changes possibly change thespin without meant and it gets to seewhat the current state of theenvironment is how does in Ramat lookright now okay and the see basically islike a general word you can see it canfeel it can touch you can measure it cando any kind of observations on theenvironment and if these observationsare what are giving it some sort of asnapshot of the current state of theenvironment and one of the mostinteresting things that you read ofcourse is histogram it's fullyobservable or partially observable is itfully observableyou get every bit of their dynamic youknow the complete information about theenvironment so you actually know theexact state that environmentis it okay the word state is going to bebandied about a lot but in fact thestate can be essentially description insome formal way of all the things thatcalled in the environment okay so it'sactually useful to understand that thisis a really really very general reviewokay there is nothing you could think ofthat would somehow not freak into thisview so in particular your lives fitinto this view you hopefully are anintelligent agent and you are dealingwith an environment and you have someactions okay and you are able to observewhat effect those amira touch those Ihave on the environment now in generalof course normal general intelligentagents it's essentially like okay what'syour goal in life that's actuallybecause much harder than also well it'svery hard to also tell whether or notyour reach so sometimes you mightactually consider a smaller like thevillain for example you are the 4:71intelligent agent okayand the 4:71 intelligent agent basicallyhas the classroom as the environmentokay and I'm basically the types oftests etc that they cannot make might begiving tests to it thank you have you dowell in them okay and so you areconstantly asking yourself how am idoing in the course people keep askinghow do I get into canvas how they getinto this how do I get into that I needto know what my current degree it is asif somehow that's connected to yourfinal grade but you feel that you shouldknow whether you are the falling behinda knife so presumably you're trying toget some sort of an observation aboutyour environment by looking at yourpartial grades etcetera okay now is yourwhat's your goal in 471 presumably theoptimal goal that Iyou all have this understanding I butwhat you really have is get any plusthat's it we don't really care whetheryou understand or not I mean so you havea particular performance metric so infact one of the interesting questionsthat we will talk about is designing aperformance metric he's afterexternal in fact what humans we setourselves sometimes performance metricsbut in most cases in fact there was aquestion of this in in Piazza - in mostcases it signals to assume that theperformance metric has been imported bythe designer so in this case I am thedesigner of the class so I input aperformance metric okay so I have tomake sure that the kind of performancemetric I am inputting he is actuallyconnected to what I hope you will getout of this course okay there are thesebeautiful I think the Peters principle Ibelieve hearts bit of as principle orsomething which say is that when ameasure becomes a goal it loses itseffectiveness as a measure grades are ameasure of your understand but and itbecomes the goal that you could actuallyforget about understanding copy somebodystuff and then get a grade and then youhave cut out of the actual realperformance metric this may sound kindof only related to this class but infact now that everybody is worried aboutPR agents taking over and mightpotentially misinterpret the performancemetric that has been given to them okaythere is a very important question as tohow do we make sure that the performancemetric that we give actually captureswhat it is that we want the agent to dookay the most obvious one that StuartRussell has been going you're talkingabout is King Midas how many of you knowhow King Midas thethe religion so he minded physicallyessentially has some of you know didlots of I guess players or something andhe got a boon from the gods and and whathe said basically was what were the coolmedia's okay I just want to make surethat anything I touch becomes world thatwas his performance metric to set forhimself and the guard said sureokay and then of course you know therest of the story then basically hetries to eat stuff the stuff becomescold unfortunately we can't digest ballhe tries to kiss his kid it becomes coldcold is not a kid anymore it is deadlots of matzah pasta and the guy isreally really unhappy okay this isbasically what he actually could havesaid what what a King Midas would havesaid to the gods is God's have somecommon sense okay then I say everythingI start should become gold I didn't askyou to take it literallyokay you should have some sense of whatpeople like that like we don't like apitch to become word you don't like ourand I hamburger to become world we wantlike anything else that we touch likethis table might become gold that's auseful thing have common senseand of course gods do you want to havecommon sense thoughts wanted to teachthis guy a lessonnow imagine the same kind of a situationthis is our guy comes Nick Bostrom whois basically has been trying to arguethat we shall be running to the hillsbecause super intelligence is about tocome and it's gonna kill us all and withmy respectful tone I'm using to describeif you know that I don't respect him alotso the kinds of things that he says forexample he uses this another examplefound a paper clip agent so this is thesecond time we heard of paper clips inthis class the pasta of course is thepaper clip file which became pushywhoever put that soft SML escapes that'sexactly the sketch I had in mind Iwasn't watching it again yesterdayit's hilarious so the paper clip issueis suppose you have an intelligentengine which has significantcapabilities it can do lots and lots ofthings by itself and it comes and sayshey what do you want me to do and yousay I we need paper clips now the guysays no that's like a reasonable thinglike you want to say I want to be richhow rich is the more money the better asecond is another thing to say so youmight be saying a paper clip agent tothe paper clip agent the more papermakes it better and so the question isnot worried that this agent will go offbecause it has infinite capabilities ithas a super really super intelligentsuper category agent it will converteverything inside every metal objectinside into paper clips so you will thenbe drowning in paper clips and thenyou're trying to say enough enoughenough but then of course it's just toobusy making videos this is kind of auseful thing to think of in the sensethat if you are actually providing aperformance metric every performancemetric is incomplete every performancemetric is increment okay and we can takethem using in some sense common senseknowledge among the orders you see whatI'm saying and one of the issues ofcourse is if the AI agents don't havecommon sense they mean well take yourperformance metric in a literal sensejust like God took - request in literalsenseand then that would not be what you hopeforso you wanted something you saidsomething else which you talk to mewouldn't and it was basicallymisinterpreted because this incompletelyunsaid stuff was completed in adifferent way by the agent so if God cando it here is can do it so this is whatis that you do have to have and in factif anytime if you you know if especiallyyour friends if then they hear you inthe year that you are taking in troubleyeah and they'll say hey what aboutthese paper clips I think when you thinkabout the one that matter are you goingto tell me that and you should look youshould say you know whatever I just toldyou okay especially matters and that's atie and there's a god themselves cannotcomplete common sense queries so reallythink arrogant right nowbut anyway so that sabha the goal thatit has for in the beginnings will assumethat taking the goals literally iscorrect okay but then we realized thatsometimes actually you have to addcommon sense knowledge to that goal sothat it actually will be interpretedcorrectly but everything so in fact yourealize that this is true in generalacross the board because like forexample I say I hope you would have alife and you just focus on this courseand if you are dying by the end of thisweek you learn you have 0 peopleattending this classanother problem stupa in generalright I'm expecting that you understoodwhat I said you have competing goals andyou just realized by what I'm sayingthat I really want you to spend as muchtime dance but come on whatever I take ashower this stuff is kind of needed okayso I'm assuming that we have the commonsense to complete them correctly that'swhat everybody assumes people give youlots and lots of goals after you takethem all literally okay anyway so that'sbasically the intelligent agentspecification and then what the agentneeds to do is what action should I donext in a most jungle scenario a ratedcan have multiple competing goals andit's trying to figure out based on howthe scores what should be its nextaction and then its performance metricessentially it is not what happens rightthem to the environment but really ithas to be over a long period of timewhat states the development go throughand such state sequence is what you aregoing to evaluate saying is it a goodstate sequence or not it's a same thingby Jeffrey Epstein had a great life hewas giving money money to MIT us givemoney everybody would take his money butwill you remember that he was a good guyno he had many many many many greatstates in his life but the statesequence unfortunately ended in himhanging himselfI don't want to stop any conspiracytheorists in this place you are a personconspiracy theorist I will help you sothe my point of course is the secrets ifyou consider Caffrey up steals life likeup until maybe 2008 you would say asuccessful life insurance a performancereally is like that this is the samething if you don't care what you knowdefinitely if you have money and you areputting it in the stock market then Idon't know why you are taking thiscourse first of all if you havemanagement you can put it in the stockmarket but assuming you have it rightwhat are you trying to dooverall you are trying to increasepresumably over a long period of timeyou can't increase your returns if youdo something that triples the moneytomorrow and then you continue doingthat strategy that makes it zero dayafter tomorrow are you supposed to havea successful or failure once again mypoint is performance is the sequence ofthe stage through which the environmenthas country it's not obvious unless youhave thought about it before and it'snot obvious to you should realize thatthe value of your life doesn't depend ona single state that you run through thevalue of the life really is the lifeit's all the states that you have gonethrough and there is some function thatI will apply and then say yeah I guessit's the value of your life is fiftypoint seven nine cubic units yeswhat do you mean flooded with on ok sosorrythat's not flood environment that's itAmy runI mean nobody owes you anythingthese see what I'm saying the worm isnot out there I don't know it's possiblethat we somehow keep that among thechildren once the world is suppose wehelp us sometimes it could actually tryto some people in the world by trying tocooperate which is some people in theworld might try to you know beadversarial with you just as the worldin our current inanimate world doesn'tcare about you so you just have if youwant to live in that worldyou can either stabilize that world thatis by yourself a little bubble in whicheverything is nice and stealing above wedo thathow are we living in a sauna right Imean you can say it backward man what isthis you know this summer stuff is backand how are you suppose people living inthe East Coast in some it winter man nowif you guys can see them totally underice and snow instead of hope theystabilize their economic they bottle ita little in a rooms which havetemperature control that is hang aroundthere you could do that and in factsometimes that's the right thing to doin fact a classic case is every timethat I see that I keep found a gun inthe home and either kill the himselfourselves are killed hopefully theparents will have them there I thinkthis is stupidityyou know you respect other you careabout returns now whatever amendmentsetc that you care about it makes nosense to have guns left unattended inthe room why not also have a few reallydeep holes in the religionand then right you like you know manthat two-year-old is going there on thisfoot like you know some sort of aanybody like saying you know this is thewhole don't fall into it and then youcome back and see that the aboveobviously the kid is Network if youdon't stabilize right then you basicallyown the environment that's why you notwhat that you wanted so sometimes we dohave to say black so in fact everythinghere this little picture captures thattoo in trying to increase your overallsuccess you may have fell in thebeginning start building bridges intheir development are building airconditioning units in the government arebuilding something else in their familyand then after that start working on theimmediate goal that to is correct and infact those are the harder problems tosolve me so this is the most generalizekind of a scenario you could have agentswhere how they need to do is oneposition and they're out that'll be theleast interesting kind of an agentimagine you create a human they justmake one decision out there and thatmeans it will matter to ask you knowtheir entire life is just it based onthe single disconnected decisions do youunderstand what I just said your lifedepends on everything you do today moreor less might impact what you will dolater on they're not tightly connectedbut they are connected in some sense ifeverything you do is completelyindependent of everything that happensthat you get to do tomorrow day afteretc life would be much simpler but it'llalso be much less interesting if youbelieve that if you agree with thatreally is that a simple classificationlearning agent which is the one that gotmost of you to this class which is thiscat okaythis stuff okay those are the conditionsthat this agent will be making if you'reright on one go you see and I'm supposein fact it turns out that based on whatyou said about the class something elseis done something else is done and thenthere are additional ramifications ofthat no indicator doesn't get about itjust looks at the classificationaccuracy so those are essentiallyone-shot decision agents those are theleast interesting agents their life ishard to sometimes but those are theleast interesting figures the moreinteresting agents are the ones wherethey do sequential decisions that keepon acting acting acting acting neverstops now acting not acting in themovies but doing actions to the world inthe worldit never stops until you die you seewhat I'm saying and top given thatfiguring out how to you know maximizethe performance metric is a much harderproblem just Jeffrey Epstein actuallywon many many small problems like youknow if you put yourself a goal I wantto go to White House and get aphotograph taken with whoever is therehe's done that these are a whole bunchof those kinds of things but as the Vicebasically failed according to most ofyou I'm not saying this but if youbelieve that then you realize that it'sa much harder problem to do sequentialdecision making than just one-offsolution making so if you ask yourselfanytime in the middle of the classwhat's the difference between this and aclassification learner it just basicallysays okay this guy should be given aloan this guy should not be given aboveand doesn't matter what happens afterthat anything is wrong the humans in theroom are the rest of the people in theloop basically take the burden it's notlike the agents performance is somehowaffected the agent is basically even isfor saying you're right seventy-six outof hundred times that's a muchsimplistic agent than something moregeneral like your lifeokay and everything is captured in thisthis little picture that's why it's notunderstanding okayin fact from now onwards anytime you seea problem in EDI problem any non-aiproblem you'll ask yourself a seminar mewhat are the kinds of actionswhat kind of observations are possiblewhat's the goal performance metric andyou'll learn a huge amount about theproblem just past it and you also beable to see that many people will findthe simpler cases which I can take youknow tend to have commercial applicationwhich is focus on thereit's not there
