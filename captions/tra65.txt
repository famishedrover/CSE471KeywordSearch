you see what I'msaying so it's just after we'reapproving is this a great idea it isused and inequality was it not it wasn'twhat I need okay so the last thing Iwant to do is well I did not be able togo all the way to the moon yeah can Istop somewhere in the middle okay stopitif I don't have all the way here this isthe first somewhere herethe question is what good outputs inparameter on sake so I need to come upwith some kindaof evaluating partial game positionsokay so that's basically game specificidea so in the clean soft actually it'sa food here is an idea which is eithersocks a extra minus one minus one iszero interpersonal and if not change anybenefit is a huge big number so I wouldsay for Indian or if it is a definitewin for max its evaluation is plusinfinity loss its evaluation is minusinfinity if not then I make up aheuristic heuristic our it's the maxthat means actually open for max - openfor you if you use this then you canswap anywhere you want use theevaluation function running as if it isthe god-given terminal values I do theragam and pick the move based on thatback everything else remains the sameexcept that these numbers previouslywere actually technique numbers herethese numbers are based on an evaluationfunction in the case of chest basicallythey would give some things like thisadvantage but units is some weightedfunction linear functional properties ofthe chess board current that would belike as a feature f1about them today the features can be forexample the number of whites means -number of black weeksokay so in fact originally if you dothis then the patent observe essentiallyis you can decide to do over start it upstop they do the min/max means and ifit's your I have to make the move thenmake a move it's not remember your moveif you still have time continue thesearch continues the search for it againin it figure out what is the new thiswill be you guys do it in the exemptionyou like some answer right so that's anytime exam this is the editor in researchthe idea is that people you go thehopefully the better the backup computerthis is Dennis will stop here too
