and you expand this morning let's sayyou get three children in thisparticular case okay and let's say thisis so this is point 1 this is pointthree this is so you take minimum of DSthat is the that more asked the keyvalue for any norm that is just aboutmore than the previous bar and saythat's the new book is well as you saidit's so the bounts are said Julie thesearch is your what I'm saying you knowhow basically first nobody to get thisone more and then when I expand this Iguess is you knows right and then I seehow which is the nor whose key value isjust trusting the previous chima thatbecomes an important why should Ibecause in the series summation businessin the textbook and pointed out the guysyou know research will not be worse thanthe averagefirst it's at most will be immersed by 3plus 1 by B minus 1 factor which is whythe first day even in the worst isthat's pretty goodon the other hand when you have Shivayou cut offs but the search tree thenyou need to in the worst case B power Tnumber 4 digit numberiterations and then it would no longerbe because my baby - well and that couldbe Italian so when people do detectivedeepening versions of uniform posturedata manually fabric ask cases they arepopping that the problem is such thateach many different they're not takingthree different values what will happenis as soon as you open the door andit'll be quieter more than one personcomes in one and one load comes it whichis good for you if only one that comesin every time you open whatever I justsaid actually vote for IDs party in thecase of idea star instead of decidingwhat is the next key value you willdecide what is the next value where F iswritten as Gokay so I'm not sure any questionsflights and you should definitely walkthrough them so this is the directedgraph and if you have if you try tosearch only the question is the order inwhich moves get expanded okay so andassume that this bore node is G and thisG is the whole note so when you pick upsome expansion you stop okay so this isactually using normal rotation where inLord is a data structure which has onefield which responds search what isdifferent from confidence because searchin multiple paths and each times adifference - okay so for example what weare doing in this particular case youguys are dealing with node n1 which is asearch then I will put it on the queueand then I will go to the queue and saygive me one to bust my opinion I willeven one that then I have explained thenit Hospice is a monocle row beforeexpanding and what a pass is enabled ordisabled node you stop andand in fact if the food is a Oh Lordtypically in many cases you want thepath taken from the room or to come tothis church north that's not too hardbecause the data structure will alwaysbe a pointer to the search node whichgot expanded to duty snow so if youfollow the right okay so in the case ofthat first these two guys should come inn2 and n3 dog often what we put on thepew and to enhance it and then you willgo back to the queue and all you get inorder for expansion is removed from theokay and then we go to and do and you goto Q and to happen to notice that theone entry of matter we just assumed forall of us to get the same answer willassume left to right residence butthat's not important here okay so n2will be picked up and - when we test itup you know and to respond to thedevoted be in the graph then you expandyour be charged a vector function says Ican give you the graph mode see so nowyou make a brand new search mode thisgraph know what happens to BC which hasa child okay now as soon as this modecomes you don't check in iguanayou just throw it out to the tube downto the openness in the case of thatfirst search the open list is actuallyokay so what that means is this m4c goesbehind MTG allergyyou will be empty cheap because that'sactually before everything that's themagic that's the reason my breasts firsthe is guaranteed to be shallow notexpand initially known before he expandsany deeper moon because of Lynch thefirst time it finds a search norm whichis a goal node before expanding a chasewith the colons of courseit's guaranteed to be optimumso the same thing is done in thispicture here bills and I DFS I noticewhat happens for TFS essentially then amfor comes in and poor goes and sits soin fact one thing obviously again justas the no key is nothing but a specialcase of chief then you can actually talkabout that prioritized if you and the Qquality is one in the case of let'sfirst search a queue priority is a deepAfghan in the case of depth-first searchis almost - the oven is ready say in thecase of uniform cost search that Q PI Pis gr m and we would know by the timeyou get to learn more how you got tothat you don't get to say hi Don oh mygodwhich can happen if you are reallyorganized they don't want us to forwardin time but they certainly know how theygot there- is your going back to the same knownfor their bus the most interesting partwill always overcome any Ruby it willalways overcome in you why because whenyou first get to it it's Qi value easierthe second time you came to Jin you metsome to be back to it the only way thatyou value will be less than zerohe's walking gives you highyou're percerin see if the itch costsare negative ahzero then you can have goopy goopy goopygoopy goopy stuff and basically that notkeeps coming again and again anything ifyou just ensure that the each pass arepositive which is true in most wordsokay change the problem okay so if youare looking at H is positive value evenif it is only one time stamp our minus70 which is still a positive number[Music]you're guaranteed to find optimalsolution the first time as far as thefirst system our packs are completelyoffokay you know because the question iswhether not before the semester is overstill use it so then the question is didyou ever have seen in you there is anoptimal path to the goal which containsrules in there ever be such a caseyou understand once a problem that hassoap from a through the best wall so Iwill go from A to B B to C to B B to Cthen D and G will not ever be optimum nobecause if that is optimal if you saythat in optimal as the stop the moonreduced India and in fact will still bereaching the book exactly have a lowercomes so that means no Asian one is notout so the interesting thing that I saidjust now is you don't know what theoptimal path to the goal is but you knowthat optimal path to the pole isguaranteed not to have any news so ifyou find routes you can kill that up andyou're still guaranteed to reach optimalthat's what dealing with graph sir she'sbasically one to stop a novel you foundanother selection order which has beenseen before or northup's parts to theworld stage which has been seen beforein this case of course South Africa thecrafts node ABC those are the worldstates the search notes are n 1 n 2 n 3so it's the search engine search for XMm happens to have seen 84 againyou don't put this guy back without younothingokay but these only works because we aresaying that the edge cars are non zeroand positive H cos can be negative thengrouping gives you happiness so the moregroups you do the more optimal you'remaking the shock of the cast is biggerthen all of this thing okay so oneinteresting question of course is if youare doing this if you want to spark thegroup's then we just have to rememberwhich norm right whether you saw thiswhole step so this is where we have tothink in terms of some close to thiscloseness contains the list of stage[Music]there it goesthe issues is basically pretty hot calmso sometimes it is an actual structurethen you have to forgive functions thisis more true happen the second of courseis how many notes are going to beseeking under open and closed pleaseremember we were keeping this open thisfeel small by doing depth-first searchfor example it's all in P times D plus Btimes D it's the closest how I cameacross this[Music][Music]so as can become a poverty which is whatI don't like the white to be gimme yourhands it so instead you will thenbasically have to come up with the kindof non-self that we come up with whichis I say you know if we make our onlyclear five six clamps and every threeweeks I'll throw away my garbage so thatthe room is not full of gross cash soreduce the number of rolls of theclothes list if you reduce the number ofrows of the most least you are notguaranteed that you won't ever expandingduplicate go but if you are careful youcan expand that you can at least stopexpanding some of the duplicated inparticular one thing that is true inmany of the undirected graphs kind ofscenarios these nodes wound up givingtheir ancestors backif you're dancing this is givenancestors back it will give some cuzit's on the ground they tend to givetheir ancestors back so a cute idea isto essentially say I will put on thatclothes listmy ancestors this ship anymoreand in fact then I don't even need theclothes list every note has white doesgoing our way back to the root sowhenever you get in you lord that shipgives the path to the ancestors intentis no detail if so refuse to open justrotate that's an extremely good idea infact that's what most of you should bedoing because that reduced significantamount of the edge detection duplicateone if you still have some cousins anddistant cousins you know being repeatedyesso essentially what I said which isevery node every Edge has positivepastures mph has positive gospel sohere's actually a a proof that you canprovideif you are innocent in subway level bylevel you're going east inspireddistance by distance from the root nodeso the sake of the concentric circlesare the lines not the depth and soyou're guaranteed that if you found asearch Nora goal node in the fifteenthousand click circular then I'm gonefor meet up until then then that must bethe best that's uniform as much includedin one passage is using lot moreinformation because it is using this Hclass but as I told you that's not thedifference between this you're insanethis is still blind search is a searchwith mommy found asked edges ok now theproblem with odd is look at this timedecade treat so again in the uniformcost search if I don't search so theproblem with that is by that isguaranteed to be optimal that means whenyou find the solution you will beguaranteed that we have found a solutionwe found is not a solution okayactually let me ask a very importantquestion why do I need to carry theoptimality by the true being before headwhy did I allow algorithms to compensateand exactly what is the value lifeexactly people understand this in factis extremely one constant at optimumglobal property the only way I can tellwhether the solution you Jane is occupyLamott this I spent my lifetime tryingto come up with optimal solution I'mcheck if it actually is shorter thanyours just myself so I think it isoptimal the looseness is a repeat up notbe is no which is why we focus on thisoptimality ensuring the proof time givea certificate that even any bozo ourinnovation our patient also can use thesearch algorithm annexes a resolutioneach guaranteed to be out I'm going tocheck this by that's not but in tryingto give this guarantee of a steamer itin these search algorithms canessentially do too much work there's aquestion of solution and there's aquestion of how much what did you howmuch computationokay expanding number of nodes expandedthat's the thing that you say that weuse at the Gustav is your insane numberof nodes expanded is is the abstractcompare everything to search algorithmyou know expands more more by giving theoptimal solution that is our okay thenthis one is more efficient okay fine sonow think of guys like this[Music][Music][Music]you know it is[Music]so here these are all white ones souniform research gets beyond to the q1
