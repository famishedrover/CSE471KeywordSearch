[Music]so how many of you have played with thevaluation thing so those who will passthe rest take this course again becauseI'm telling you by doing this so you geta better sense of power here - it was bythe way at the end of last classsomebody company personally here I wantto give the person's name but actor cameto me and told me that they do not knowwhat the odds arebecause they were having a problem withsome 20 watt engines and they are askedfor to fix it I said just send me aclimate northern Piazza and they saidwhat theater okay so now here's the dealso I'm for some of the happiest studentthis semester that I've seen and thatwas the thought there was only oneproject project zero because apparentlyI talked about it in the class and thatnothing else actually was required topass this class and so until the personfound out there's something calledtheater infer going to ask for them butthe business of battery once said thatthe man doesn't dream has no advantageover the man who can't read okay theperson would be novellas Piazza is thesame situation as the people who knowthings the answer and ominously lookingat it so please keep that in mind a lotof things are going on there anyway sothis is you should I thought up show youa limit of this permit but you shouldplay with this to get much better senseso here is a in the infinite horizonit's an authority process it's aGreenstein problem okayand so I said inso we can do various kinds of things thepolicy evaluation policy update valueiteration 3 evaluation is in fact by theway just so that you know I sent thismessage to actually Kevin so my earswill be falling okaymy kid which also reminds me there wasthis other point that I made let me takelike a nice picture of this huge so okayI could be sending me by email beforethe class saying today's attendancewould be the followingI am looking for a hundred percentattendance in my class okay anyway sothere was a bunch of people that I'veactually asked you guys to look at canyou explain how the dream dress the waythat I'm going to see in a minute andalso what will happen if you change thistown factor and actually that's justa question that I wanted you to take outin two days to a cause you get to thatin a second but before that let me justlet me show you what happens here okaythe numbers okay so right it's how muchright and notice what happens if I getspa validation and stop okay you noticefirst of all that is a bunch of it'sbasically going actually interestingthis is olive oil in an asynchronous waywhich we will talk about the differencebetween synchronous versus asynchronousbut clarify question so there are somered ones where everyone who arebasically low value states and the greenones are positive value States okay sothe question is if you let the thing gothe green is are a splendid okaydoes it make sense to you as to why thatmeans is that that's basically the pointof valuation notice what is happeningyes it's not clear for you from therethat one has an award 1.0 it's like apeak to our state this is minus one mostof our guys especially every time theyget to you so minus 1 here minus 1 hereeverything else basically has 0 avoidmost right so when you start one of thequestions that we start out we said wecan run finite horizon value iterationeven though you're running her eyes thevalue facial problem right you can dothat and you can do this by essentiallythe only difference is that you will putthis discount factor so you just saygive up times the neighbors value bestneighbors value plus the reward of mythat's how you just keep changing theweather right so the question of courseis watch the initialization you knowsince we did say that the initializationfor a finite horizon was every state hasits reward and its value right so that'swhat we do is using either so everybodystarted there they want being given andthey want being zero is neither bad norgood so that's why it's alright andthere's a bunch of guys who are myfinances those they are basically theimmediate reward is negative okay sothat means at the 0th iteration thevalues is actually meeting okay andsimilarly this guy the value of what the0th iteration will be positive 1.0 whathappens in valuein general what happens essentially isthat northnext to the so essentially if you comebut you're trying to take the max likethat in the way the value iteration itdoes you are saying I like now my viewon is pretty bad but then I have richneighbors around me I can reach theseneighbors by taking the good actions inwhich case I will be able to get some oftheir value to me that's basically whatI've done here training you understandwhat it is so it's like almost it's awonderful life kind of historic no manwho has which neighbors will beparticularly for except probably the USbut in general the point is if you havewhich neighbors even sure the YouTubereview terms like lineage that's whatdefinitely is happening in valuationokay but the fact that you have whichneighbors is the message that needs topass to you you just have a long faceyou look inside and then then as theiterations in the valuation progress themessage passes to you that hey what fivesix miles from you there are some richpeople and if you take an eighth of mineactions you will get to go there with itso then you suddenly wake up and say I'malso quality that's what value equationis so now if I do the value iterationthing you notice that what is usuallythis guy is the only guy that's readbut there's only the message boxes andeven bozos here they start thinkingeventually about twenty thousand actionslater we can get there so we do ourwhich you're someone said so we needthis obvious like Max's and update setwhy what's going onyes computation and just basicallylooking and computing your job datingyour value so in fact the differencebetween sink commas and asset your bestvalue iteration and let me actuallymention that when we have this picturein front of us synchronous valueiteration is the one that we think aboutwhich is basically you have one fulliteration so the 0th iteration everybodyis valuing and then everybody lockstepchanges their value for the firstiteration then everybody in lockstepchanges their values for the seconditeration that's the most obvious thingyou would think up when you're doingvalue iteration right that's asynchronous value iteration but it turnsout that for value traditions toconverge the property of valuation inthe case of finite horizon you have todo synchronous because eventually you doneed what to do when you have one stageleft two stages left these stages leftfour stages level right but in the caseof infinite horizon we're using the sameprogram that we wrote for finite horizonwhat we don't care about theintermediate results that's just doublygoodwhat we want is what is the value thatwe converge to and can be converged tothe optimal value faster okay so oneidea of doing that essentially isactually connected with what's called asynchronous value iteration it is sayingyou no longer have to do value iterationsynchronously anybody can make up to gettheir neighbors some of who have thecost equation values some of you whohave their seventeen depression valuessome who have their 95th iterationvalues and then you just break up oursay okay based on these neighbors andthe actions I can do I would update myvalue and you go back to sleep and thenwake up I mean later and update yourselfdo you see what I'm saying if you dothis then everybody can essentially doas fewer asfrom day one they can update theirvalues and its terms of that as long aseverybody updates their valuesinfinitely often value iteration willconverge whether you do synchronous orasynchronous and in fact you can showthat asynchronous value iteration ismuch faster in converging because oftentimes what you might wonder one is thatthere are some important states whichmutually get you towards the high valuestates on those are the ones whosevalues are changing those are the onesthat you want actually updated actuallythis idea of a sequence value iterationis a definite idea I am pleased that wedid actually discuss what is written upin the textbook which is the same but Idid show you the alpha beta pruningexample where he seemed to have donedifferent depths and different places sothat's completely about that here evenwhat even if you don't go to the exactsame uniform that so the question is inthe game please imagine I allow you tosay you know the default is about fourply but then you can go extra few pointsyou need GM say then would you go if yougo extra you play across the board thatlooks like again same depth but if yougo in some direction extra few playingin other directions you just stop at thefork line that would give you nonuniform depthright how would you do this what wouldbe the heuristic you wouldto decide whether or not you would wantto go further in some direction in thegame days one idea is to keep track ofthe backed up value of a node and seehow fast it is changing as you go down 1PI 2 pi 3 PI 4 PI if it what other is itchanging in the last several play thenit's not a come I sent this what's up Isent search it's become question it'skind of you know how much in thoseplaces you don't want to go extract likeif I'm at the ramp then the directionwave the value back up value by mid maxis changing very rapidly you may want togo deeper there because those are thedirections where the game is not quietif you looks one way and then uh onemore step later it looks completelydifferentone more saturated changes again inthose cases it's better to go deeper ifyou wanna say so that's called percentsearch in the game trees and a similaridea is asynchronous value iterationwhere the guys whose value is changingbig time from one iteration to other youprioritize them in fact the name of thisparticular idea is called prioritizedit's VP so nama synchronous evaluationis sweeping the impacting ones see theyhave the again you can try it again soeverybody changes their values oneimpression impact and the case of righthi sweetieyou basically keep track of whose valuesare changing most for example and thensome update their values how far someheuristics you can use for that but thebeauty is that we do that here you'relikely to get better convergenceokay all of that you can see withrespect to this and again let medownload this and see that that we needso you can see that rents are going awaythe means are slowly increasing and eventhis guy has become clear now zerobefore it became we have that plus oneyou see once again it's a wonderful lifestory if you have rich neighbors whereneighborhood is defined in terms ofactions that you can do likeunfortunately having neighbors with highwalls makes them unreachable so you comeback there but if you have an actionthat which you can actually reach thatdeeper when you have the actions toreach those neighbors then in some senseyou can get a piece of their value toyourself because I said a value minusthe cost you to to travel there he isnow adding to your well this is commonsense see what's happening and then theother thing you notice is that when itis actually going I can't be sureactually how you find that that code isout there somewhere down here the codeis written hereI'm not sure whether you get thecigarettes or a sickness but just bylooking at the picture it seems as if itis asynchronous okay but really the mostimportant thing is do you realize thatvaluations are now disperses the goodnews if there is good news and one ofthe interesting things actually in thevalue iteration is for some guysactually this is happeningokay see anybody I mean as I do this seeif any of these guys first become redand then become green see that[Music]I'm going to be sick it is actuallypossible during the value iteration tofind that your value is worse than yourreward because you're surrounded byneighbors who are even bigger loser thanyou are right this you're insanethis one actually I am only going to goto people what was that nameand I have to take an action so suddenlynot only am i unhappy I also become evenmore unhappy because everybody aroundthese losers but then after a whilesomebody at the far end finds that theaverage neighbor the message comes backin so if the textbook actually there isa nice little picture for valueiteration about how the value iterationpicture which most like this if theybasically show how the nor the differentnotes values converge to the final valueand so suppose there are you know yousee that some of those notes will comedown and go up and converge that'sbecause in the beginning when thevaluation started they're only gettingback to the back rows bad news and thensomewhere some they know that the guysaid the closer to the rich people willget the positive message which will thencome the ring true is you're insaneall of that fun stuff you can basicallymake senses by playing with that so nowlet's ask these two false questions thisone although a rigid is guaranteed toget the reward of a state concealmentit's not guaranteed to get the value ofthis true or falsehow many people think it is true I'mgoing to be putting it's false butanyway so why can anybody say why it'strue why isn't it possible that I willget the value I have in the state if I'min a state which has a high value whydon't I get ityes um because there's a poss likebecause it's a Markov decision processeven though you could want to go one wayyou could go the other wayand so let's say you want to go forwardand the poor not it's a really amazingreward but backwards has a really badwart you can accidentally go backwardsand get no value from the high valueState okay so you are there to give thesame in expectation if this didn'thappen I mean on the average you willstill get the value for that is specificare you when you take an action it findsup giving you the longer constant thanthe one you expected yep so then I'masking you a different question of thisquestion is it true that althoughenraging is guaranteed to get the rewardof escapism it's not guaranteed to getthe value of the steal even inexpectation even in expectation that'sthe interesting question in so isanybody else has an idea as to why theysaid is trueeveryone says cool so is that right hereother than is we asked my district wasthe idiot goes it sticks in this hainanyou stink will it get that random thisis thank you came to college peoplegoing to go to college you came tocollege you hang around for four yearsis your life going to become better yourbank balance will suddenly be lower butyour life getting better know why I'mlike the one that you just as soon asyou going to the state that what washesover you value actually is the maximumvalue you can get for this fee if youlive optimally from here on if you liveoptimally from here on so the value ofthe college is taking into account thatyou actually show up to the classesyou'll actually go to the career fairyou'll actually get interviews andactually keep a job all that stuff yessir so quick question so to almost belike a lottery ticket in the sense thatthe optimal value you can get from alogic is super high but unless youunless the perfectly right thing happensyou won't get all the value from thelottery ticketwhat's your hand Mikey Michael Michaelso much things that is like a lotteryticket how many people think that whathere sitting here is about somethinglike a lottery well then people wouldnever raise their hands I would justassume they have no idea what's going onin the class since the start of AI tomake this thing that by the end of thesemester you'll say no I have this deepknowledge I just need want to make itwash over people I'm assuming I justmake the obvious assumption you knowlike what Churchill said I'm sure it cansomebody came to Chowchilla and told himthat you know what people say that youare opponent Clement Attlee is modestcompared to you and Churchill said yesClement Attlee has much to be modestabout that's what I assume about silenceyou have much to be silent about thatwhy you got nothing to say that's whyyou're not saying so please you know ifyou're here and he thinks you actuallyunderstand speak up so somebody whoraised their handyes[Music]to use the question it's a very bigquestion actually I think this is likemy first short security masses like I'mgonna go take in the whole thing is likea lot I'm rebooting life is like aknockdown so this guy and then there wasa flash point it is Kalin is maybe daybefore yesterday and then found thatessentially is anti radio Apsara gettingswatted so he somehow on the road rightand then and then basically what isanything and some neighbors coming byone guy if they came by and said thankyou you can come down God will take it'sa lot bigger like I know some of youprobably heard about this one isconnected to this and then then comessome green like a helicopter to givethis guyand somebody else comes to Ataritogethereventually the waterways as he dies hegoes to heaven or hell talks to a guardcome on man I can play I wish it all mylife I sent you you know why you getdespite the fact that I met you all thisstuff because these high points of acneI don't need to do anything you can doafter buying a lottery ticket to makesure that you live in you know if youare into one of these us racing peoplewould be similarly you can be same letmy might think I think me there's a lotactionsI just if you think it is it's becausethe actions have stochastic outcomes ifyou don't differentiate between a fewlottery it will just by that you canseat what's s a stochastic world whereyou keep taking actions you miss thewhole point of lightness or at thisforce that's the point of value value issaying that this case you do have a wayout yeah pretty good state if only youkeep track of what is the optimalactions if you get to the state get anice you know queen-size bed and sleepyou would be like that guy and you willbe washed away the water bar behind ifwe instead in disrepair as soon as youslapped on a queen-size bedgood that's a good man that's how uglybut then you're not it reminds me of theend of last classsomebody TMR said I have a question whydo you all this talk about death becauseI'm trying to make sure that you knowand how not to die that's like the mostimportant lesson of our learning how notto die okay thinking you're neva freeand I don't have anything anywayjust remember that value is telling youthey behave you know if you use yourbrain if you shut your brain if itdoesn't help you can come to college andsleep you won't get any value of thecollege and I wish my urge to actuallytalk about 100 on this picture is to doit by grill which is this beautifulplace in Himalayas in Darjeeling andeverybody makes a body in the morningand ghost dragon Italy so I also readwith them and then I found that all ofthem were looking at the sunrise okayeverybody was looking at the Sun likethere might be a cup of coffeelike it was so important why the afterwhen I got this sidethere was beautiful kanchenjunga whichis the third highest peak in the worldbeautiful these were the bozos who cameto get here but these are the optimalactionthe other thing that came back home Isaid man we wanted my cat he'll neversama will have seen some fine or CHwhat's the big deal why do you basicallyoptimal action is what gets you thevalue sequence of actions is this whatI'm saying here is this somehow onlytrue alpha only true our foundationprocesses are not true of a star searchit's too obvious not such - if I were togive you H star and I can't understandwhat this particular state and then thisone tells you I'm 15 minutes away fromthe goal you say yeah I'm Kristin youare both on the sit here you will now goto go if you do random actions you willstill not go to go but instead youexhibit tells you that makes you dooptimal action something from there youwill get to the bowling 15 units of okayany more questions on that secondquestion the smaller the discount factorthe longer it will take value iterationto converge to are false you work themsomewhere else okayactually if you guys have to do updateour similarities slipping also seen inthe back please okay the smaller thediscount factor the longer it will takevalue iteration to that much
