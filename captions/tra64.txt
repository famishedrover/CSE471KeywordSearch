they got okay if you haven't figuredthis outcan anybody tell me a mom using strategyfor detector yes something new now soyou should never play this game afteryou get sick of itany salt of course it's all up to beable to solve the game in essence whatyou need to do extremely you like to goout and sleep somewhere else thank youso what you need to do is you have tosolve it you need to make this entirebut tic-tac-toe is actually possible todo for chess know there are more nodesin the chess game 3d that there areatoms in the universe don't even get mestarted about go you see what I'm sayingso many of these have hugely largesearch please thankfully that's why theyare maxed outokay yes sir whatagain please understand when it's reallyimportant point like not okay solvewhat's us win over the bozos okay womenor the master for humansdoesn't mean you're solve again you arejust better than them and then somebodyfrom mas will come to induce with us theonly way this issue that across thegalaxy nobody can beat you in this gameis if you're proven to yourself thatyour sodomythat means there's a belief that showingthat the winning strategy is basicallyworking for large ships unless therehappens to be some fluke obstruction inthe space you see what I'm saying that'swhy it's kind of interesting and in factthis is part of the reason why eventhough chess and go have huge searchtreesyou think there's almost sound they arenot found you just listen all is fromthe earth not from Mars not asupercomputer so you just did betterthan he should we do okay so you'regoing to find what should be your speedsuch that nobody can go faster than youaha what is the current reigning Olympicchampion with a little dopey and youshould go faster if you can universe seeflight speed of light until you go atthe speed of light will not be sure thatyou will never you overtake it you couldbe extremely happy saying I'm like anOlympic champion that just means thatyou know the nearest car will overtakeyou whatplease understand this solving isdifferent from doing better than theother players okay yes no no get solvingis not living and Lucy solvingessentially says in this okay so here'sa beautiful job thankfully I remember atthe right time okay so these two superintelligent robots are playing the gameof chessso first robot takes three nearly threefull minutes and makes it the secondrobot chance of something that such assecond robot takes three minutes andsociety know one of the things below youhas no wings for you you may not noticeit you may still keep making more andmore news and you know basically becauseyour brain is small and you don't seefar enough and these super intelligentrobots essentially this is no fun forthem to a chance such as a movie theymake remove it see already so they'reactually you know have you ever seen ahappy robot you know use our Kazamabecause there's nothing interesting sothat's the point something is actuallysolving essentially respect for who youropponent is what their conversation thatwill it is incredible matter you have awinning strategy but over a specificopponent who depend on all sorts ofthings like do they make mistakesafter you make mistakes any of thesethings will come into play okay thoseare very different thingsso again is considered solid if it canbe sure that the max player has awinning or at least non losing strategythis means that the backup value in thefood will match really is positive infact if it is like this you can show itto be positive that means solved infavor of match if it is negative it isodd opposite to max in which case Macshould stop playing those games shouldnever play again video guarantee to newsright either it's not either of thosetwo then it's still fun me because itdepends on the opponent and you are anaccountant strategies okay that's whatthey don't worry okay so here's thequestion already from now onwards it'sbasically this is game research that'sit there are two more things we'll talkabout one is how to do this search if Ihave to assume in the beginning shortlyand all I care about is there some treewhere the lowest nodes have some numbersattached to them which is their valuesthese notes are values currently inassuming there are technical valueslittle later we'll assume those of aheuristic values okay that's the onlydifferenceokay so if I give you a tree like thisthe question is what's the best way toevaluate this you saw this you just needa mean - I meanmax ups need to put it down this is notthe range or the related program rightin particular let me ask you questionsimagine a game with the branching factorB and depth D that means you applybasically you opponent this is Neptuneokay let's say that G factor B in thiscase III suppose I have a really someuniform game tree branching factor B anddeputy how much time do you think youspend doing the min/max foundation didyou guys see that because youessentially have to go to each of thesenodes so P power D is the amount of timeyou spend to figure out the value thatcomes up here how much space how muchspace with yousomebody's it should somebody shouldtake responsible its speed up the isyour hand and say what is it yes why isme daddy how about you that B times Dtimes D by D is just much I'd rather askus okay about that we times D plus twoextra points as I'm there okay okay isit D poverty are P times D those are thebig differences how do you get threetimes to be here you have to do thatfirst search on that team you have to dothat first search on battery it'simportant to realize that typically outof our problems and all that means ofunderstanding is not make you look atreality at the same time you would neverlook at the entire tree you graduallyslowly expand that tree in thedepth-first fashion this is very funnyokay first of all if you don't do thatfor search you won't get me countrysecond of all if you are doing thatfirst search then this beautiful ideacalled alpha beta pruning which allowsyou sometimes stop expanding huge piecesof the search tree without evenbeginning without we will looking at itand guarantee is that we will move didnot change the final value de Jong's areinsane so that's alpha beta Rooney andit fully works because actually first ofall you will get first and you are ableto realize certain structural propertiesof the search which will allow you tosay on the sagathey're not interested okay those arethe two things that we want to talkabout them in it but before that beforeI go forward notice the father anythingthe value of value that you get yet yourealize one of the values here it's justa simple point but it's useful to knowright it's not trueother times it is true for deterministicgames with me my strategy okay okay okayso what are you going to do actuallythis time what I would do is actuallythe depth-first and alpha beta pruningat the same time because in fact youdoing that first search alphabeticaltakes experience using just please useme and so I do both of them at the sametime you understand what I'm saying okayso two for oneso I start there essentially rememberthis is the tree in case you come acrossa question if I hit it but this is theoriginal train you have okay and I'mbasically three that you have you knowyou only like the problem only sees theparts of the tree it expands rememberthis is a very big point we made earlierwhich is implicitSergi graphs this is the big differencebetween how the search you needendearment and the search you do here wetell the graph was extension of it wasin front of him here the graph wasimplicit if you proceedit basically is defined in terms of thenode and child already functions I amjust expanding the entire graph takestime and much of what a starmuch of what even this approach to uswithout we're pretty nice to be able tocut pieces knowing that they won'taffect okay so in this fear that thiscould move along our that first searchso I basically start from here right andI'll come here at first these peopleexist to look at it right nowand I'll ask I'll do it tell you no noit says no okaythen I go back on top I say are you everno no it says yes so what's your valuethree at this point I know that we don'tbe visiting this nor is it me know doyou know do you know what the valuewould be here in the enddo I have a bound on what's the bound ithas to be less than or equal to threeright but I didn't know the movementwhich sees a child each value basicallydo not know that is value is at leastless than or equal to T whether that'show the theta power allow for betathat's turn the beta power but thatdoesn't matter so now when I go up I seea cop so then I take minimum of mycurrent bound which is three and 12which is three so my new bound is stillless than or equal to 3 then I go here Isee a rate I think the minimum half mycurrent bound and eight which is againthree and I now have a bounded stillless than equal to 3 then I say even anext child the program says sorry youknowyou know at this point you say whateveris my bow is my darling this is what I'msaying I'm acting like a program nowwhatever is my pound is my values haveno more sugar okayafter I saw it and that's over then thisbecomes an actual value T now the momentI hear even acoustic thing this guy nowhas a year manI know something about this get upback bound is greater than or equal tothree right because this is the max okayso first I'm doing and then on the wayto doing the first one keeping track ofthe bombs that's why I'm saying thatcrying now please just keep track of theinformation that we're giving you and ifyou don't do it then you just not acomputer science person okay that wetalked about they might be useful butpruning is one of those ideas whichmeans you're just mad advanced for someyou don't have a program you don't thinkit's not one of those things where maybeif somebody told me I would use it noit's not a dualistic it's just theobvious way of a mutation okay it's justthat's what you're supposed to me okayso that's greater than equal to 3 nowthe brain animation starts I'm going tobasically get the next guide and sothat's my next min node from here okayand that mean node has childrenokay and the first time that is toolsthat make this will be less than orequal to 2 rightyeah then I should get it next timeshould I should I why not because thistime is never take anything other than aminimum so I have you not seeing thereal tree you in fact your programdoesn't know what the tree is in factwatching I'm not looking at here mightbe as big as a gorgeous tree but youstill decided I don't I just this isgoing to be equal to do we will neverlearn anything more than to go up andthe guy about will never take anythingless than three so Who am I trying toimpress at this point why doing searchlike we do here a huge amount of searchif you want doing researchits vast damn just I won't know it'slike basically we are being stupidthat's why I'm saying after we recordingit's just you are supposed to realizethere is no reason for you to do searchhere and second thing did I look at whatis here in fact you can't even see whatis not written here right you never knewwhat I could hear suppose I go ahead andchange some of the stuff here some ofthis part of the tree exactly bit ofmuch bigger addition have changed veryimportant that these when I am sittingon this table it becomes convenient thealpha-beta pruning is the big whateverman like a monster arpa-e I meet thoseeverybody thinks it's extremely hard butthen it's not at all hard you justthe obviously and people wind upfocusing on all the wrong things likefor example - so since no house I'm notgoing to be very much of a mileactivational but really it doesn'tmatterthis is a losing match nobody from thisranch is ever going to affect what thegame - this is offensiveokay what you still fight like this sametime okay continueso that's what it saidand I can do this the next one I have a14 that means this is less than equal to14it's the allottee in the middle of theweek every time you feel like I needeverythingmove touch togetherso something is always bigger than Rless than R equal to something so I justassume everything is happening so inyour party I won't give you anythingless than 40 between even 14 there arestill lots of lots of options so it'snot 30 now I go forward I got a fivegears so I look at a file with the 14 aswellWow they file so I take the mini in thiscase minimum of 14 and 5 that becomes anew bomb so this becomes less than equalto pardon but okay now at this pointI hope doing that now okay at this pointthis becomes less than or equal to twoyou can it's very important you might besaying how do you know that means youactually went and played that I wouldbefore getting here so you cut at thelast time we talked you through you gotit just so happened that what youthought is zero notes here is theimportant thing when you stop lookingyou know how many people you startbooking that's it and if you see I lookat the people I would look then you arein from Maryland okay so that's itthat's affirmative Rooney plusdepth-first search and I did that forsearch I never had under open listanything more than three times denotesand I am maintaining these bounds forevery node that I'm updating in fact itdoesn't really matter it so happens thatthe Autobots these are called betapounds and is a very interesting otherquestion if I even though this is just atwo layer threeimagine you have multi rarity okaysomewhere along this there was some Lordthat basically they were some node whichsaid less than or equal to two I stilldon't have to expand anything far belowthat no you see what I'm sayingso the actual traffic is my feet are onebig know what I ask is mysmaller than any of my ancestors alltalk about and I have both midnight maxancestors only max ancestors will haveapocalypse it's not actually importantto remember our fine meter it's moreimportant than our greater than or equalto less than or equal and this isalphabetically and in fact as I searchedthe across slivers this that will becomedeep but it's the same idea the same areyouthere's no difference okay so basicallyokay look at this tree this one doeshave multiple layers very quickly sinceash you showed me everything you don'thave any computer just tell me what theback up back up no boundaries so thiswould be this would be what value thiswould be what value here three and fourhere for ya is a maximum so six fournine four and five is four three andeight[Music]4:40 which is back tigerit doesn't matter send it what soanybody who's even here for Pat yourchoice you want to kill yourselfokay so I can just basically say a squadI'll just take this oneyeah so that's what I didI am I question and you do algorithmanalysis if you do this you understandwhat right here is your assignment foryourself you are committing on this andcheck what gets cut out and what valuesand money is actually half of it upruining the example and and it has 200 Iknowthen is it become time[Music][Music][Music]so by the way hopefully in this nobodywould ever feel alpha-beta pruning issomething like a heart it's not it'sjust down bound Magnus the kind of thingcomputers are made to me the kind ofthings people are that it which meansthey make for good midterm examquestions because they're always tryingto tell computers are taking the exam orpeople are doing things so that's okayyou reduce the question in fact let's goback here so we saw this guy basicallythere was a cup here right in thisexample after to return imagine thefollowing thing remember when youexpanded these to get children butchildren can be number queuing any otherfor doing that for search suppose yousee what I just said whether or not youtaught depends on the order in which youlook are you surprisedwhether or not you will continue to datedepends on the order inright it's the same okay so it turns outthat actually depending on the orderalpha beta pruning can tiny box I'm notthat anything at all like it up thequestion is many cuts and loss how muchis box if you are okay in fact you cansay the problem is hard it's real realhard very very much unfortunately that'snot a lot of in computer science youhave to talk about polynomial complexityexponential complexity decidableundecidable experience the space otherstuff that's what makes you come overstroke so the next question is in thisparticular scenario I know that in thebest penis he came back how much can itcut in the vesicles so then people aredenotes right you know in a uniform ratewhat do you think would be the number ofnodes it can come after you touch some Vbody will it become what we time streetrecord II minus one it's not obviousright it turns power so somebody have todo this one so this is actually tellsyou how our happy Alliance part resistormeans because but I did this analysisthis analysis is tells you exactly howmany notes for the unit on three is howmany of your over dollar fandoms namethe last what you find a different majorfind out who is okay we return the artof algorithms volumes one two three andthat it's too painful to get this typeset to be just without a program forfights and irritation and he inventedlogic which was not and then we wentback to short whitey and he still aliveby the river very pressing car DonnaHamilton is the Nagas live anotherchilling evolve in us and you know it'slike a giant uh popular science itsdominant animal and one women areinvolved in this classit wasn't Yahoo a cone on his king rightit's an old stuff okay so anyway this ishow the best three looks and it's notobvious until you think anything be thebest three for example this part andthis work showing or four layers fourlevers in this part it has to look atall these three it could have cut beforeafter if you take these three it wouldhave gotten a value here at which pointwithout the bound here at which pointgroup please to get a bound here and ifit's really like a delicate stock inthat much and similarly
