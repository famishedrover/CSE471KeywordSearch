brings us to the question of how to comeup with good you listening this is thebaseline fabulously okay and in factthis is where this picture that I shallbe long back but along is right manypeople would think that the heuristicsthat what would be cheap computers booksso the heuristics and we said let's saydifferentlyyou know what you see this picturebefore and you saw set differencebetween make sense to be there this isit's a cheap illusion but you can havemore and more knit style is this itcomputer plan optimal plan from everystate and then use that as a length andbasically people would only look forUNIX here and obviously nobody wasrooting for instance here but whatreally happened was the heuristics thatwere useful to this approximatereachability analysis and they actuallydid quite a bit of time and in fact inthe textbook they essentially showbasically lies the problem using what'scalled planning logistics and basicallythat once you do the very rough fewstatesso I mean I'm not expecting youso if you want you stop doing wholiterally exactly to produce this partyfrom the initial state and doing theprojections partnership okay that wouldbasically tell you exactly how manystates and which is what I want to dothis approximately because doing this isfaster than just doing planning on fireso what we do is in a sense what it saysis what it stays in you stop havingthese membranes between the spinach eachstate is its own thing and remove themembranes it's like some membranes theeasier to say if you do this you getsomething like thisthis is not a state but this is a unionof all the states around the union ofother states you need you know elementwise Union so this is guaranteed to bean upper bound on anything reachable sofor example if I'm trying to see whetherP and Q can be done in two steps and ifyou don't exist in the two steps levelcan be if it is exists if it's still notwhatever it's not existing it can bethat's what I promise using this unit ofyour choiceand that points up being extremelyuseful so in fact as I mentioned if youlook at the end of the textbook asentence in another chapter you see thatthat particular paragraph industry butbased on something we need in this classbut the idea is using approximatereaching to the clear houses get anestimate of the length our particularlike one simple idea that actually youcan properly understand is this idealast plan you will speak whichessentially says ignore all the deletesfractions if you do not agree needs forthe actions then planning problem iseasy to solve still not zero cuspid iseasier so and that would be called youknow delete relaxation realistic andvery transparently Houston and is tofind the optimal planokay this will be a peaceful in thesense that it turns out that findingoptimal plan including beliefs so I giveyou actions okay this is what actionsare the ideal English department just asI believe this is a lemon tea for areaction that try to solve the problemoptimally in terms of make say whateveryour classmate wrinkles the cost of thatplan would be a strict lower power infact one of the issues is if you areinto heuristics from the historic searchmuch of that chapter 10 about theheuristics it kind of makes it a lotmore connected to generating new recipesbecause a bunch of one of these picturesbunch of things that happen in planningat one point of time was really theyused to be powers would be like thisevery planner and every problem thesearch cost is exponential okayand what change essentially is even withus even taking into account thatcomputational improvements essentiallythe big difference was using goodheuristics Thomas and the heuristicswould use abstractions in fact if wekind of idea remember we talked aboutpattern in today statistics at the endof the class and of such class is usedexcept individual time also other kindsof you knowfor example so you know before I forgetthis point is going to be a guy giving atalk Ronny Carter is going to give atoss and youthis guy's the researcher who actuallywill talk about these himself displayedapproaches this kind self and after thewords that are used for these actionswith preconditions and effects they canbecome factor approaches and I mostly dothat actor dictator coaches ordeterministic when Ronnie Cochran willtalk about how to use those kinds ofthings for a stochastic man and a wholebunch of some people ask what we doinghow to a whole bunch of things I diduntil about eight years back was thiskind of stuff in fact most of that's whythe chapter and then the other part isthat link that I sent you the one thatwe're more interested now is in usingthese kinds of learning but when youhave a human in the loop and so thehuman might have a differentprecondition effect model than what youhave and so your plan might be differentfrom what the human expects you'replanning and if they surprised eachpoint either you can do what they expectyou which is explicitly and into what iseasy for you and L there is no questionby telling them to do a model of mind -okay
