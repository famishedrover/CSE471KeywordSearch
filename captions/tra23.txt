if the initial set is complete you canuse it's actually written on CW then yousee in some other places two pros morean assumption which means Elam iseverything a fatherthese are false okaythen I can apply these actions so forexample if I apply pickup in to thisstate I can generate a new statedirectly I don't need a charge anywaythe punch line is just basically look atwhat are the things that pick up a issaying because X is say so for examplefor pick up a to be doable it better bethe case that ends up table and hand shebuilt there is on taking hand isn't so Ican do it then how do i construct thenext state in the next state I know whatwill definitely be changing but thingsthat will be changing her given by thedefinition of pick of X in the new stateX will be held in table and if you wantto be our table and hand would not beemptied and x1 weekly so what I do incomputing the next state is I like thosethings in the read variables every othervariable that is not mentioned here Ijust copied it over from the previousstate autograph over the steps so thispiece will make sense because theactions are changing only a fewvariables in this case the number of arespond but in any which word they willbe like 10,000 we're equalseach action have local effects itchanges a couple of variables so thiskind of representation of the action canbe a lot more compact than the atomicrepresentation of an action in the caseof attack atomic representation allactually have the same size it will benumber of states by a number of statesmatrix just outside if I do this now Ican get the next state and similarlyapply the ovenaction I get other state and so on I notgive to a Star Search others basicallyright so I have a way of starting fromthe state I can generate new states andI know where to stop I stop whenever mycurrent state wipes up having the bothvariables to be exactly in the form Iwant do you see what I'm saying so youcan actually look at this and and as alittle it's an awkward exercise do theversion which we talked about which ishad you picked up a step above of B atthat point you will get a state whichshould have not clear being and hadn'tand so you sell for is that okay thisidea is called for aggression you'rebasically going in the power directionI'm going to take a few more minutes 25minutes maximum to just complete theregression part and then we will be donewith this and then we can talk aboutsomething else next timeso the recreation parks if I'vementioned this earlier you can start inthe other direction you can start fromthe goal state now for the whole stateis not clear be on hand in T it's not areal state right because any full statewhere clearly is if you know Falls andhand engage true is actually consistentwith the co-state right it's a partialcourse it just like just passed the examand the short you're wearing on that daycan be many many different shirts thepants you're wearing that day can bemany many differentthe length of your hair can be many manydifferent values all I care about isthat you passed the exam right so it isactually surprising that I should beable to do backward search from this inthe harmonic start search and a completegraph you can always go in the backwardof the forward in the case of childgenerator function you cannot gobackward because the char generatorfunction and goal test are you know thatthe goal test is if the goal test forthe piece of code you don't know how togo backward here in stop be good testbeing an opaque code it is just tellingme that test the goal will have thisfollowing variables having these valuesokay so then I will start puttingactions in the backward Directionmind-bending what are applying in actionthe backward Direction mean and byfilling the word for it he sees like onthe other one progressionthis one is regression it's a differentregression from the linear regressionstochastic regression in learning it'sthe same word for a completely differentmeaning okay here you are basicallyregressing actually the word regressionhere is close to what happens inprogramming language if you are tryingto check the correctness of the programyou take the program as I go we will seewhat are the conditions you shouldsatisfy and then you regress thoseconditions through your program and saythat they put satisfies them that's howyou prove correctness of programs okayso that's and it turns out a plan asequence of actions in a small proprogram is actually a line program ok sowhat I'm going to do here I'm basicallygoing to show that I can apply put downa in the backward direction here if Iplay in the backward direction what itmeans is this has to be the very lastaction before this step if this is thevery last action before this state thenwhatever this guy has not givenhas to be true before right so two downit did give me handedly so I don't needanything here but I still need notclearly because money was not given byfoot down it is the last thing that mustbe true before you such that the goalwill be true after you write and then ofcourse since your last banner are yourprecondition should be true before youso far put down a what are thepreconditions holding it right that thisis what I'm saying then there's only oneother question for example can I do asthe last action on stems back in be asthe last action can I do as the lastaction start evening if you the last guya complete stack a be I'm sorry Scottybees actually find no let me to see whatI dostock it be it's fine no sake needsfinancial that's what I did here I thinkso that can be will work let's getsomething that what I was looking for itis pick up a let's move it let's just dobecome a can I do pick up a from herethe point I'm trying to make actuallyI'm blacking out right now but the pointI'm trying to make is if you have a lastguy whatever you kill nobody else has todo but if you killed one of the goals asthe last thing you did then nobody willbring those goals back do you understandwhat I'm saying right very nice guy andso for example you had a anything whichgives clear B as an asset cannot be thelast action because if it is the lastaction clearly will be true of otheraction so you can't regress the skin toover it so the one thing that'shappening in the population you have tocheck the preconditions before applyingthe action the regression we didn't sayanything about that it turns out thereare preconditions there to it is you canonly do the action if it does not killany of the goals and which case in whichcase every cool it gives doesn't have tobe given before it anymore anything ithasn't yet given has to be given beforeit and all its preconditions have to begiven before you okay that is basicallywhat is written there and none of thisone of the interesting questions is Ican actually the regression like it doan action which doesn't have any usefuleffect I'm not still finethat is basically the last action thatUB is serious on let's say that thatwill change any of these variablesactually not being useful be useful it'sa secondary thing not acting the goalstate is the primary thing it's likephysicians think physician first don'tcause any harm to the patient and thentry to see if yousave the patient so in the case ofregression you should make sure that theaction has no effects that areinconsistent with what is in the goalStateif so then you can do the ration as alast one and then any of the courseattics DB you not have to make it truebefore everything else you have to makeit uniform and then you have theprecondition of that this is calledregression I'll stop herethink about a real moment is that everymorning
