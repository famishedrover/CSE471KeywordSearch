this sort of brought up this issue thatactions might actually be sometimes justgathering information about the state ofthe world as against necessarilychanging the world even though to someextent what Heisenberg said is trueevery test eventually also have someimpact on you like if they do hugenumber of x-rays of you to make surethat you would have cancer you will havecancer if you what I'm saying tests alsohave some impacts but you know but thepoint is sometimes that test will havemostly our country being comfortinformation-gathering okay so i snatchinthese things so we will try to end withthat quiz so these are the definitionsaccessibility deterministic static it isso deep and discrete actually discreteessentially means the system goesthrough a finite set of discrete stepsbut all of these will be available onthe piazza so you don't need to takenotice of it i should take pictures ofme i won't be around so the discreteversus continuous is the spacetrajectory a state of continuous statesor is it discrete set of connectors thatmakes a difference and similarly agentsnumber of pages in the element are theycompeting are cooperating so in factagents are part of the environment oneinteresting question is if there areagents in the environment the agents ofmental states and the question wouldthen be modeling their mental statestrying to figure out what the otheragent unbelieva knew who is driving nextto me is actually trying to do is shetrying to run me out of the road or isshe just going on with her life thisbecomes important is when there areactual animal agents in them runs in ronbreed itself doesn't care about you onebitthe static beam element doesn't careabout you but the other regions can becooperative can be competing can be indifferent environment is always adifferent it is you're insane tounderstand thisremember the stupidity of the Star Warsnarrative and if you don't watch theFamily Guy episode on Star Warsnarrative where why would you make DeathStar which is supposedly completelyinviolable except there is this littleplace where it will just go you get thewhole thing Rosa well because you knownot Nature doesn't care you know ifthere are lightning such suckers verylow chance that lightning we need to getbut if Harrison Ford is coming he won'tbe eating the rest on the Death Staryou just cooked it you see what I'msayingsaying I have this great house exceptthere is this one little problem that Iput for aesthetic reasons which is whatfamily guesses about Starks works it'sstupid if you have agents who haveactually adversarial to you another andnature is not out to get youso it doesn't matter okay that once momwho would have killed her um that starif it was just natural occurrences butwhen they have people who can makedecisions to kill the Death Star that'sMahal is a huge before okay soadversary's had a quite significantlyokay let's try thissince we brought this upokay so I don't know people are gettingabout to start doing but here is myquestionhe's just static but in the past itmetallic he is it true or falseChelsea static while Scott is dynamicJustin static my ispotter is which oneof us most of you have given so in factI want to show you can see what I willsay so 99 percent of you said true andone percent said false you can argue inmostly just in static and I mean attendthe soccer is Donna knows because butyou are not doing anything ball is stillmoving across to the second question solet me just finish this and then now thesecond questionokay the second person chancesdeterministic my father is stochasticokay 99 percent four percent said falseanybody who said father would like tosay something as to why this statementis gone yes which one okay that'sactually do that but good points to makeso in terms of what is deterministicright after you are near the portconfiguration is deterministicif on the other hand you consider yourmu plus your opponent's move as one movethen is you cannot see actually what'sgoing to happen to the world because theopponent also has so normally you cansearch estimate and hdem because rightafter you of move you know exactly whatthe Botox figuration will do okaythe that is fine the next one is chessis fully observable my soccer ispartially observableexactly first thing I'll show you this Ijust keep changing my micro-expressionsI'm seeing this anyway so I didn't justit is fully observable spy star socceris pasta partially observable but whoare the somebody who said in theminority could they explain why theysaid it's falsesomebody who said false yeahthat 20% has disappearedthis is a bad guy who gave the monetaryreason actually not true it's fine tothink that it makes sense so who saidjust this statement is falseyes go ahead what was the reason so heis 20% of the grade of this process goesto himno that guy's answer will still workhere if you want to actually make senseof why just is partially observable youhave to think that what you really careabout is my smiling up arrangement mymuumuu apparently and I know what I'mdoing I have no idea what that parent isscheduled by the way one of theinteresting things that just camethrough he isthey will play conservatively the issueperfectly rational opponent and so insome sense that too is deterministicthey can assume given my move that myopponent will make the move that willcause the maximum damage to me if SPAWARguys thought so they would not put thatwhole there were just hoping for youknow kind of dumb opponents but by theway because just gives just programs isyou perfectly rational opponent inmodeling the opponent they don't losemostly their time to drop but then ifyou make them play your two year or in afew armies who can't down the differencebetween a chess piece and a piece ofcandy they will still take for everymove you make less amount of timebecause they don't know maybe this kidis kind of making some kind of a trickafter first few times of heating of theokay so that's so that's basically howto convert into given is the last oneand that you know she is just discreteviolence order continuousokay so actually I'll ask one morequestion before you leave on what stuffbetween just one first let's ask thisquestion about observability just what'sthe spotter he spoken fully observableor not that's why I actually liveErica's program innocence but the pickerachievement then alphabI can alphago was playing adeterministic game which is going chessbetter to play poker you have to wateryour opponent because you don't know thestate of the time we need to consider
